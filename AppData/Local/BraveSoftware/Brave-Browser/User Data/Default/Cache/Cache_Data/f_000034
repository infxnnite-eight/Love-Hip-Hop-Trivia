<p>Would you want all the transactions in your bank account to be publicly available to anyone who cared to look? Probably not. Our bank accounts contain private, sensitive information. That transaction information reveals a lot about our financial situation, who we buy from, and who sends us money. But if the thought of your bank transactions becoming available to the public makes you uncomfortable, it’s time to look at your Venmo privacy. If you use Venmo, you’re likely revealing a lot more private information than you think.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-venmo-works">How Venmo Works</h2>



<p>Venmo is a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment app. Its basic function is to let individuals send money quickly and digitally to other individuals. It also has a strong social component that makes it almost like a fusion between a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-safe-are-paypal-venmo-zelle-and-cash-app">payment app</a> and a social network. You are able to have a friends list like you would on a social media account. You can also include comments with payments or requests for payment, and you can see a “feed” of transactions your friends have made and their comments.</p>



<p>Venmo can be very useful. It makes it convenient to split bills with roommates, divide up restaurant checks or event tickets between friends, or pay someone back for the money they loaned you. However, it sometimes gets a bad rap because <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/venmo-scams-consumer-protection">scammers love Venmo</a>, too. Scammers like that once they convince you to send them money, it’s almost impossible for you to get it back. They like to incorporate apps like Venmo (and other P2P payment apps, like CashApp) as their way to get paid for other scams.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-you-re-revealing-on-venmo">What You’re Revealing on Venmo</h2>



<p>When you sign up for Venmo, your transactions are public by default. Anyone could get on Venmo’s general feed and see your transactions. Or they could access Venmo’s public API and see all your transactions, including the usernames of the people you sent money to or received money from, the dates of each transaction, and any comments. It is possible to manually hide your transactions in the privacy settings. But if you don’t know it’s public by default, you may be publicly broadcasting more than you wanted to reveal.</p>



<p>An even bigger risk to your Venmo privacy is the friends list. Your friends list is public by default as well, but unlike your transactions, you cannot make it private. Venmo also encourages you to import friends from your phone contacts or from Facebook. If you do so, it becomes a completely public list of your connections. Anyone can use that to uncover people you pay regularly. It can be used to identify your personal and professional connections.</p>



<p>You may wonder how much harm it can really do to have your list of connections publicly available. But it can also be exploited. You could be <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/cyberstalking-toll">cyberstalked</a> through your Venmo info. People have exposed reporters’ anonymous sources or professionals’ private client lists through Venmo. US federal agencies have used public Venmo friends lists in criminal cases. And one fan even <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a30611566/bachelor-winner-peter-weber-venmo/">figured out who won a season of <em>The Bachelor</em></a> through public Venmo connections. It may not seem dangerous, but a malicious actor can do a lot with that data.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-venmo-privacy-concerns-in-the-news">Venmo Privacy Concerns in the News</h3>



<p><em>The Bachelor</em> contestants aren’t the only people who are having problems with Venmo privacy. <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo">BuzFeed news reporters</a> found President Joe Biden’s private Venmo account, which they then used to find First Lady Jill Biden and uncover private social connections. And a former aide to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas left his transactions public, which exposed several large payments from lawyers that had been Justice Thomas’s legal clerks.</p>



<p>Privacy experts have <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-and-mozilla-venmo-clean-your-privacy-settings">warned for years</a> that we need to be paying attention to Venmo privacy and what we might be revealing. Public Venmo data has revealed drug habits, breakups, couples’ fights, and even what kind of pet people have and where they prefer to eat.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-realistic-risks">The Realistic Risks</h3>



<p>Chances are you’re not the president, a Supreme Court justice, or a contestant on <em>The Bachelor</em>. But even ordinary people are at risk. Say you go to a bar and pay the cover fee through Venmo. If the bar hasn’t made their transactions private, there’s now a record of when you went there – along with everyone else who went to that bar.</p>



<p>Pay your rent with Venmo? A dedicated <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/stalkerware-with-eva-galperin">stalker</a> may be able to find your address. Use it to split the happy hour bill with your coworkers? Someone may be able to find out where you work. Trying to keep some transactions <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-send-secrets-securely-over-the-net">secret</a> from someone? The exact thing you’re trying to hide may be publicly available if they wanted to look.</p>



<p>There are other risks, as well. If your transactions aren’t private, scammers can see you in the public feed. They can then send spam requests hoping you’ll accidentally hit “Pay” and send them your money. One of the biggest risks, though, is that it’s yet another data point companies can use to build a profile about you. If they know who you’re connected with, what you’re buying, and when they’re buying it, they can use that to manipulate you in the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-improve-your-venmo-privacy">How to Improve your Venmo Privacy</h2>



<p>Now that you’re aware of the risks, it’s time for some good news. It is possible to <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/stay-safe-online-wiretapped-fbi">stay safe</a> and keep your private info private and still use Venmo! Most of the steps towards increasing your Venmo privacy are very simple to take.</p>



<p>First, change your privacy settings so your transactions aren’t public. You can do this in the Settings menu by tapping “Privacy,” tapping “Default Privacy Setting,” and selecting “Private.” But this only protects your transactions from this point on. To really increase your Venmo privacy, tap “Past Transactions” and set that to “Private” as well.</p>



<p>Second, use an anonymous username. Lots of people use their real name – Venmo encourages it so it’s easier for your friends to find you. But if your friends can find you, so can anyone else. By setting it to something more anonymous, you can protect your privacy. Change your username in the Settings menu by tapping “Edit Profile.”</p>



<p>Third, limit the number of friends you have. You can’t hide your friends list, and that’s a big Venmo privacy issue. By removing friends that you don’t regularly Venmo with, you will limit the amount of information someone can get about you. To remove a friend, go to their profile, tap the “Friends” checkmark, and select “Unfriend.” If you feel someone is a threat to your privacy, you can also block them by going to their profile, tapping the three circles in the upper right corner, and selecting “Block User.” Someone who you have blocked won’t be able to see or search for you on Venmo.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bottom-line-on-venmo-privacy-risks">The Bottom Line on Venmo Privacy Risks</h2>



<p>If you’re using Venmo, you may be exposing more information than you thought. There are some steps you can take to improve your Venmo privacy and use the app more safely. But since Venmo doesn’t allow you to make your friends list private, there will always be a little bit of your information exposed.</p>



<p>The way to get the most security is unfortunately also the most inconvenient: Use Venmo as little as possible. By using the app less and paying with other options when possible, it will have less of your private information to potentially expose.</p>



<p>There’s nothing wrong with using Venmo. It is convenient and can make your life easier in a lot of ways. But if you are going to use it, it’s important to be aware of the risks, follow good security practices, and take steps to protect yourself. You can use Venmo without exposing a lot of private information. But you do have to take some steps to protect your privacy.</p>

<p>Scammers have learned to use systems like shipping, rental cars, and rental homes against us. And they’re really good at staying under the radar. They also know a lot of <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/scam-methods-fool-brain">psychological tricks</a> to manipulate us and use our own brains to get us caught in their traps. In order to avoid scammers and stay safe, it’s important to know how the scams operate and what steps you can take to spot them.</p>



<script async="" data-type="track" data-hash="32XDRaOgO0" data-track="184" src="https://app.fusebox.fm/embed/player.js"></script><br>



<p><em>See </em><a href="https://www.easyprey.com/scambaiting-with-pierogi/"><em>Scambaiting with Pierogi</em></a><em> for a complete transcript of the Easy Prey podcast episode.</em></p>



<p>Pierogi is a scambaiter – someone who interacts with scammers in order to trick them, waste their time, and learn what they’re doing so the rest of us can avoid them and law enforcement can take them down. He protects the innocent and vulnerable from scammers through his YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC9EjyMN_hx5NdctLBx5X7w">Scammer Payback</a>. In addition to exposing criminals, he helps victims with his technology and cybersecurity knowledge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-helping-people-avoid-scammers">Helping People Avoid Scammers</h2>



<p>Helping people has always been Pierogi’s driving goal. Even when he was fresh out of college and doing IT support, he was happiest when he could be the guy who fixes the problem and helps people. After leaving IT support, he did some work in infrastructure, then moved into security because he found the topic interesting.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I learned a lot around the idea that you can’t keep up with this [cybersecurity]. It’s really a matter of time. </p>
<cite>Pierogi</cite></blockquote>



<p>He learned the fundamentals of how to secure companies and the implications if they weren’t secure. He also got the opportunity to talk to government officials and other people solving real-world challenges. Through this work, he picked up a lot of valuable information.</p>



<p>Eventually, he saw a few scambaiting videos and found what scammers were doing interesting. He’d heard of scams and gotten a few <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-fight-back-against-robocalls">robocalls</a> before. But for the most part, he’d managed to avoid scammers. But these scambaiters dove into the details of how the scam worked, what goes on in a scammer’s mind, and how the whole process is a business. He decided to fire up his computer and start talking to these guys. Since then, he has left the security industry and focuses on trying to protect people from scammers.</p>



<p>Pierogi keeps hearing stories from people who’ve been caught in scams, and it continues to give him purpose. There’s a lot of pain – the <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/cost-of-cyber-crime">costs of scams</a> aren’t just financial, but also involve a lot of emotional distress. His goal is to protect people. He doesn’t just want to take down scammers. He also wants to make sure ordinary people can avoid scammers and stay safe.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-effective-scambaiting">Effective Scambaiting</h3>



<p>Pierogi has done videos where he confronts scammers and the “money mules” collecting packages and helping the scammers move money around. The scammers are using systems that we’ve built for legitimate reasons to do their scamming. They use shipping companies, rental companies, even startups. They create multiple <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/whats-a-burner-number-and-why-do-you-need-one">burner phones</a>. And they have an elaborate system to take money from victims and turn it into profit.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The scammers are using our systems against us. They’re using our shipping. … They’re using AirBNB. They’re even using our startup companies. </p>
<cite>Pierogi</cite></blockquote>



<p>Pierogi recently did a collaboration with other scambaiters <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/tech-support-scam-calls">Jim Browning</a> and Mark Rober, who is best known for “glitter bombing” scammers. Mark was able to get access to a lot of scammer packages and create fake ones. Through their collaboration, they sent a variety of fake packages, including glitter bombs, through the scammers’ money laundring network. It was a four-month project that involved a lot of phone calls and a lot of work. But in the end, one person was actually arrested. Pierogi thinks this may be the first arrest in the United States that happened because of scambaiting.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1506271660-1024x683.jpg" alt="Pierogi's scambaiting efforts have caused one scammer to get arrested." class="wp-image-6285" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1506271660-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1506271660-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1506271660-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1506271660-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1506271660-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>From this project, he learned a lot about the money laundering process. Now he’s not just interested in helping people avoid scammers and protecting people from scam calls, but about how money laundering is going on right under our noses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pierogi’s Craziest Experiences with Scammers</h2>



<p>Throughout his scambaiting experience, Pierogi has had some interesting interactions with scammers. They’ve ranged from ridiculous to sad, but his craziest one is the time he got married to a scammer.</p>



<p>When scambaiting, he often uses a voice changer to pretend to be a grandmother. Scammers have proposed to his grandmother character many times. But once, they actually went through with it. He went on a website and had the scammer read out the whole “Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today” speech. He went line by line, and they did vows. It was very cringy. The scammer kept saying things like “You’re my bride, I want to kiss you,” and making kissing noises. Meanwhile, Pierogi was streaming this for thousands of people. At some point, it was just too much. He didn’t expect it to actually get that far, but it was funny.</p>



<p>Another scammer wrote out a will for this grandmother character. He claimed to have all this money, and the scammer wrote up a will where the “kids” wouldn’t get any money but would have to participate in a Hunger Games-style competition to get one of the cars or houses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-learning-the-language">Learning the Language</h3>



<p>Pierogi has been learning Hindi because he thinks that immersing himself into the culture and learning the language they speak can help with information gathering. India is a very big country, and different scammers are often in different areas. But Pierogi is learning to hear different cues, even in just the way they speak, that can tell him a lot.</p>



<p>He’s had a lot of phone calls where he starts speaking Hindi to them – often something like “Gussa kyu khar rahe ho” (“Why are you getting so angry?”) or “Dhanyavaad” (“Thank you”). Many of them freak out when they realize the person they’re talking to can speak their language. He doesn’t abuse or curse at them, just proves he knows their language.</p>



<p>If they ask how he knows Hindi, he will often say, “Well, I know exactly where you’re based because of how you’re speaking the language,” and start throwing out landmarks that may be near them. Some of them instead pretend like they don’t speak Hindi and are actually from the US. And he released a video recently where one scammer completely flipped his lid and became abusive.</p>



<p>Personally, Pierogi doesn’t get scared of them. But half the time he ends up in tears on his streams because it means so much to him. He can often hear victims in the background, or hear the scammers laughing about the victim or celebrating like they just closed a big deal when they successfully steal from someone. It makes him feel very helpless since he can’t do anything about it at the time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-saddest-interaction-with-a-scammer">The Saddest Interaction with a Scammer</h3>



<p>Early in his scambaiting career, Pierogi encountered a scammer who went by the name Jerry. Jerry tried to steal a bunch of money from him. To help with the scam, he had a victim he called his “secretary.” He had her call Pierogi, and her voice was trembling through the conversation. It was the saddest thing he’d ever encountered.</p>



<p>She told him that she almost got scammed out of a million dollars, but Jerry helped her get the money back. Pierogi asked if she was okay and if she knew this was a scam. She assured him that it wasn’t a scam. Later, he emailed and texted her asking her to please tell him if she was in trouble because he wanted to help her. She said she wasn’t in trouble.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The scary thing about it is the manipulation that they put on their victims. </p>
<cite>Pierogi</cite></blockquote>



<p>Her voice was trembling when she talked to Pierogi. There was definitely some element of manipulation or even extortion going on. If she didn’t help Jerry the scammer, she would probably lose everything. Scammers often turn their victims into money mules so they end up helping the scammer scam other people. It’s extortion on top of fraud, and it’s horrible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Scams Work</h2>



<p>We have to think about scamming as a business. They call their victims “customers,” train their “employees” on the phones, give them scripts, and have a system. They hire people to work in <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/call-center-scams-secrets">call centers</a> and beat into their minds that these are customers and they’re helping them. Some of these scammers actually believe they work for <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/common-amazon-scams">Amazon</a> or whatever company the scam is pretending to be from and that they’re really helping people.</p>



<p>There’s a really low barrier to entry to set up these scams. It’s fairly easy and inexpensive to hire people to work at a call center. You can give them cheap computers and use free or pirated software. The phone systems are virtual, and software like robodialers can dial and connect the calls for them.</p>



<p>From there, the front-line scammer goes off a script. Their main goal is to connect to the victim’s computer. They claim to be from a legitimate company – Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, or anyone else. A common story is a refund scam. They call you saying that someone made a high-dollar purchase on your account and it seems suspicious. Of course you want to cancel the transaction and get a refund. By being personable and convincing, knowing the script, and keeping the victim on the hook with a fake story, they trick the victim into letting them connect to their computer. Then they pass the victim on to the second-tier scammers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-second-tier-of-scammers">The Second Tier of Scammers</h3>



<p>The second line are the more senior scammers. They know what they’re doing and they’re proficient with computers. Now that the victim has given access to their computer, the second tier are the ones who will actually steal the money.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A lot of times, scambaiters want to depict [scammers] as … goofy people on the phone who don’t know what they’re doing. But they’re pretty well-trained. They do know what they’re doing. </p>
<cite>Pierogi</cite></blockquote>



<p>In the scambaiting community, there is a temptation to portray scammers as people who don’t know much and aren’t very smart. That can give the idea that it’s easy to avoid scammers. But Pierogi gives these second-tier scammers a lot of credit. They’re trained and they’re smart. They know how to work through a bank account and trick you into giving them thousands of dollars.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-they-get-your-money">How they Get Your Money</h3>



<p>The most common way the scam works is by manipulating your bank balances based on how much you have. Say you have $5,000 in your checking account and $12,000 in savings. According to the story they told you, they owe you a $1,000 refund. The second-tier scammer will add a zero onto the amount of the refund and move that amount from your savings account to your checking account. Then they manipulate your screen so it looks like that $10,000 that just landed in your checking account was from Amazon, Microsoft, or whoever, not from your savings.</p>



<p>At that point, the emotional manipulation comes in. They claim you added an extra zero and so got refunded way too much. Put yourself in the shoes of a grandmother who’s not great at computers – this is a recipe for disaster. The scammer tries to get you to give them the “excess refund” back. Usually they ask for gift cards. But sometimes they ask for you to wire money or even put cash in a package and mail it to someone who will launder the money.</p>



<p>If you realize it’s a scam at this point, you may think you can avoid scammers tricking you out of your money. But they have access to your computer. They put a mechanism in to lock you out. If you realize it’s a scam, they don’t mind. It’s now become a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/ransomware">ransomware</a> situation. You still have to pay them or you won’t be able to access your computer again. (Pierogi’s tip: If this happens to you, try 123456 as the password to unlock your computer. He’s had this happen to him several times, and they use 123456 as the password a lot.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emotional-manipulation-makes-it-hard-to-avoid-scammers">Emotional Manipulation makes it Hard to Avoid Scammers</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These scammers know where to tighten the screws on people emotionally. </p>
<cite>Pierogi</cite></blockquote>



<p>Part of what makes these scams so successful – and why it’s so hard to avoid scammers’ tricks – is the emotional manipulation element. There’s a report of a student who lost $30,000 to a scammer pretending to be from the <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/social-security-scams-impostor-scams">Social Security Administration</a>. The scammer claimed their social security number had been used in money laundering, and they got scared.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1464732771-1024x683.jpg" alt="It's hard to avoid scammers' tricks when they can manipulate you effectively." class="wp-image-6286" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1464732771-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1464732771-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1464732771-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1464732771-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1464732771-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Pierogi himself has gotten a lot of harassing text messages from scammers. Sometimes when you don’t give them the money, they will move to harassment. They will say they’re outside your house, or that they know everything about you. And in cases, this can be true. If they have your phone number, they can use a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/hidden-dangers-people-search-websites">people search website</a>, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/propertyiq-opt-out-guide">property records</a>, or even <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/google-search-result-removal-tool">Google search results</a> to find out your name, address, employer, family members’ names, or more. “Pierogi” is obviously a pseudonym, but Pierogi has had scammers call him by his real name. That’s one of the scary things that he tries to highlight in his videos – scammers know more than you think.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These scammers know a bunch. They know your husband, your wife, your kids, your parents. They know everything, and that … makes it scary. </p>
<cite>Pierogi</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid Scammers by Spotting Common Scams</h2>



<p>The refund scam mentioned earlier is a common scam, but there are others. Another common one is the fake arrest scam. The scammers call people and claim that their child or grandchild is in jail and needs money to get bailed out. Another common type is social security scams. Many people think that it’s easy to avoid scammers pretending to be the Social Security Administration if you’re not getting social security income. But they have stories for everyone. A common one is that your social security number was used for fraud or someone <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/preventing-identity-theft-with-adam-levin">stole your identity</a>. The goal is to get you scared so you don’t think too hard about it.</p>



<p>Pierogi gets a lot of voicemails claiming that there was fraudulent activity on a variety of accounts. He also gets a lot of voicemails claiming that there is a lawsuit against him and he needs to call back immediately. That one tends to get people pretty nervous. Some have even said things like, “If you’re at work, you need to get home immediately.” The scammers are so confident that they think they can bully people.</p>



<p>A common thing they do in multiple types of scams is ask for your ID. They want a photo of your ID somehow – whether you scan it and email it to them or snap a photo with your phone and text it. That’s a big red flag. Don’t send photos of your passport, driver’s license, social security card, or any kind of ID to anyone claiming to be official. Think about the DMV – you’re sitting there for hours to show original documents. That’s how the government works. They won’t accept your ID through text or email.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>You’re not going to get a texting relationship with the government with some random phone number. </p>
<cite>Pierogi</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scammers Coach Their Victims</h2>



<p>Scammers coach their victims on what to do and what to say to dodge the protections put in place to help people avoid scammers. There’s a mental and emotional aspect to it. Stores like Target and Walmart are getting better at limiting people’s ability to buy gift cards and questioning them about it. Banks are generally good about questioning suspicious money movement.</p>



<p>Scammers know there’s going to be pushback, so they coach their victims. The cashier is going to ask why you’re buying $3,000 worth of iTunes gift cards, and the scammer will tell you to say it’s for personal use or it’s a gift for your grandson. The bank is going to ask why you’re trying to transffer $40,000 to a bank in Thailand, and the scammer will tell you to say it’s because you’re opening a business. And unfortunately, the victims are listening to this coaching. They’re scared. Scammers will often tell victims not to even talk to their spouse – that’s how scary and personal it gets. Especially with scammers pretending to be the government, they claim they’ll know if you tell because they’re watching you.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I think of huge aspect of [scamming] is the mental manipulation the scammers are putting their victims through. </p>
<cite>Pierogi</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is Responsible for Helping People Avoid Scammers</h2>



<p>Big banks invest in cybersecurity to protect their infrastructure. Pierogi assumes there’s some kind of <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity">AI</a> or algorithm watching the accounts and putting up red flags. He is curious how the algorithm decides what is suspicious. In the past, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/antivirus">antivirus</a> software just determined whether files were good or bad. But now, hackers can use known good processes to do bad things. It’s now more about behavior and how things and people act.</p>



<p>In the end, it comes down to the question of who’s supposed to be watching for problems and helping people avoid scammers. It it a service you pay for? The credit card companies? Financial institutions? Vendors? Big stores like Target and Walmart? Just us watching out for ourselves? Who has the responsibility?</p>



<p>Major corporations have a budget for cybersecurity. Your grandparents don’t. Someone struggling to put food on the table and pay bills won’t spend the time or money to improve their security. Our <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/isp">ISPs</a> aren’t protecting us on the internet, and our wireless carriers aren’t protecting us from malicious phone calls. Right now, the responsibility for avoiding scammers and staying safe in cyberspace is pretty much on us.</p>



<p>Some wireless carriers are trying to screen out potential scam calls, or at least notify you about it. Some banks and financial institutions are trying to help, and some big box retailers are getting on board. Pierogi thinks that to stop scams, it will take all kinds of companies working together and figuring out how to work with law enforcement. We’ve made some steps forward, but there’s still a lot to be done.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take These Steps to Avoid Scammers</h2>



<p>A lot of people think that if they hear someone say a certain thing or say things a certain way that they would immediately know it’s a scammer. But you can’t make assumptions like that. There are scammers starting to pop up in the United States. You can’t assume it’s easy to avoid scammers because they’re always easy to spot.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We have to take it upon ourselves to have that personal security … we have the responsibility to protect ourselves.</p>
<cite>Pierogi</cite></blockquote>



<p>We have to be aware. Pierogi calls it healthy paranoia. The internet and technology are great things, but we have the responsibility to protect ourselves. You probably lock the doors of your house at night. Similarly, sometimes we have to “lock” or “put passcodes on” our minds. If someone calls you with something that sounds legitimate, you can trust, but also verify. If you’re a trusting person generally, verify with someone else. We trust big names like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple with a lot of things, but this becomes an issue when scammers use it against us. When someone gets you on the phone or leaves you a voicemail, use as many sources as you can to find out the truth. Maybe that’s checking your account online. Maybe it’s running it by another person for a second opinion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protecting-others-too">Protecting Others Too</h3>



<p>If you’re passionate about this, have conversations with other people, too. Your grandmother, mother, siblings, and children need to know about this stuff. Scammers don’t care about age, race, sex, religion, or anything else. Tell your parents or grandparents that if they get a call that sounds fishy or someone wants to talk about technical stuff that you don’t understand, they should call you, your brother, or someone else. Then if they do call, don’t look down on them. Remember, you’re watching out for each other.</p>



<p>Pierogi suspects that part of the reason older people are more suscpetible to scams is because they grew up in a more trusting time. When they were younger, kids could go play outside by themselves and locking doors wasn’t as big of a deal. People seemed more trustworthy, so they’re more quick to trust. If a scammer can come up with a plausible story, they are more open and quicker to trust them.</p>



<p>We sometimes depict scammers as just silly people. But they’re very good at what they do. It’s a business worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and it’s built off getting people to trust them when they really can’t be trusted. We have to protect ourselves and we have to protect otheres. We need to have conversations about these types of scams.</p>

<p>Here are 4 top parental control software choices recommended by WhatIsMyIPAddress.com.</p>

<p>In 2023, there a two categories or parents or guardians. (We’ll simply say parents through this article to make it simple.)</p>



<div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p><strong>The unaware and clueless (but caring):</strong> Those parents who allow their children (from ages 5-18) to have access to phones and computers and any program or app they wanting to explore—and are either oblivious to the dangers kids face or don’t know they can do something about.</p>



<p><strong>The newly aware and concerned:</strong> Those parents with children who’ve had bad experiences online or that realize how truly harmful and quite dangerous the internet can be for kids.</p>
</div></div>



<p>It’s time for parents to be aware of the biggest predator out there, the one that’s active and pervasive.</p>

<p>Every day and every minute. It is the biggest influence on your childrens’ thoughts, dominates their time, steals their focus and lures them into a world that’s more illusion than reality.</p>



<p>Who’s the predator?</p>



<p>The internet.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-parental-controls-that-was-then-this-is-now-nbsp"><strong>Parental controls: That Was Then. This is Now.&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Was keeping kids out of harm’s way easier before the Internet? It had to be. Before the internet, parents and children could navigate their universes fairly easily. Sure, teens and kids could find trouble on their own, but their spheres of influence were pretty normal.</p>



<ul class="has-background" style="background-color:#d7eefb">
<li>Friends at school.</li>



<li>Neighborhood friends.</li>



<li>Sports buddies and teammates.</li>



<li>Groups and club classmates.</li>
</ul>



<p>Parents could be involved with their kids’ lives fairly easily.&nbsp; Protecting them seemed somewhat possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That all changed shortly after the turn of the century when the internet truly arrived. And that wasn’t all that changed. Cellphone technology exploded. So did social media sites and online apps of all kinds.</p>



<p>All this was supposed to make our lives better, more streamlined, and more connected to people, information and resources.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It did that, and more. It also has given rise to online content that has no rating, no restrictions, no barriers to entry and no concern at all over potential negative impacts on society, truth, misinformation and children.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The dangers that exist in the online world today are real and not an exaggeration. You probably know that yourself by now. If you’re a parent or grandparent, you might be well aware that the children are exposed to ideas and content that you probably do not approve.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="300" height="139" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/18-adults-only-300x139.png" alt="18+ Adults Only" class="wp-image-6251" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/18-adults-only-300x139.png 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/18-adults-only-1024x473.png 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/18-adults-only-768x355.png 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/18-adults-only.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-taking-the-fight-to-the-internet"><strong>Taking the fight to the internet.</strong></h3>



<p>You can’t do anything to change the internet itself. However, you definitely can do something about what your kids can do and see on the internet.</p>



<p>That’s what the concept of parents getting involved with their children’s internet usage is all about. It is simply the idea of taking a stand and choosing to have parental control over what your kids can see online.</p>



<p>And that is where <strong>parental control software</strong> comes in. Parental control apps and programs were created for parents who care enough deeply about their children’s well-being and future. They don’t want the negative influences of the internet harming their children.</p>



<p>Here’s the most important point. The negative affect of the internet is something society cannot afford to ignore. Parents need to know what’s going on&#8230;and what they can do.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-s-a-crisis-when-it-comes-to-protecting-kids-online"><strong>There’s a crisis when it comes to protecting kids online.</strong></h3>



<p>You’re going to want to investigate a handful of programs after you read this article, starting with a few of the best-reviewed that we listed above. Taking care of your kids could be as simple as choosing one of the apps and using the features that you think are most needed for your family, and your peace of mind.</p>



<p>Here’s a brief description of four parental control apps mentioned earlier. This could be the first, yet decisive step you can take today toward protecting your kids online.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-parental-control-software-programs-work"><strong>How do parental control software programs work?</strong></h3>



<p>Parental control software programs put you in control. It lets parents put up a digital, protective wall between their kids and the internet, between their kids and social media usage, and between their kids and today’s popular apps.</p>



<p>These programs are purchased by parents, installed and controlled by parents (on their primary device), and then installed on their children’s devices. Then, from behind the scenes (almost as if behind a magic curtain) parents can control their kids digital lives.</p>



<p>You can load this programs and protect a wide range of devices&#8230;whatever your kids and using.</p>



<ul class="has-background" style="background-color:#ddf0fd">
<li>Personal computers (PCs using Windows). PCs are popular with gamers: (examples: Dell, HP, Lenovo and Microsoft).</li>



<li>Macs (Apple computers and laptops). Preferred by teens and college students.</li>



<li>Chromebooks: used at many elementary schools during the pandemic.</li>



<li>iPhones and iPads (by Apple). The most popular phone choice for teens.</li>



<li>Android cellphones. Samsung, Motorola and Google for example.</li>
</ul>



<p>Let’s take a little deeper look at these popular and higher-rated parental control programs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-is-the-media-in-all-this-crisis-nowhere-to-be-heard-from"><strong>Where is the media in all this crisis? Nowhere to be heard from.</strong></h3>



<p>The media and news outlets do not regularly report on the dangers of the internet when it comes to children and teens. There are times they will report on stories, but only if a child has been abducted by a predator, or if a sex-trafficking ring has been broken up.</p>



<p>Even then, it’s simply a news story that doesn’t get a lot attention—certainly not the type of attention it needs.</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">What they don’t report on is so disturbing, because the problem is real and it affects the most vulnerable segment of the population, our kids.</mark></p>



<p>Consider this: If you personally are not aware of the types of stories and statistics involving internet dangers affecting kids, that should tell you something. The media and developers of websites and apps seem to be ignoring what should be a hot-button topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A school shooting will make the news (and rightfully so) because it’s sensational and makes headlines.</p>



<p>The internet content vs. kids crisis hasn’t reached that level&#8230;yet.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maybe-you-do-know-what-s-out-there"><strong>Maybe you do know what’s out there.</strong></h3>



<p>For sure, there are plenty of parents that no exactly what type of content is out there for all to see. Perhaps they know (do you know?) because they are adults, it’s okay for them to act like adults, and they know the risks and consequences. (Yes, they still exist for grown-ups). <strong></strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-now-take-a-step-back"><strong>Now take a step back?</strong></h3>



<p>Do you really want your kids to see that?</p>



<p>You would think that most parents want to keep their children safe from the dangers of the world&#8230;.and most parents likely would agree with you. The parental instinct to protect their kids is strong.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>But most parents, even caring and generally protective parents, have a blind spot that could prevent them from recognizing the content threatening their kids’ well-being today. Maybe even their family’s well-being.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-let-this-be-your-wake-up-call-before-something-disastrous-truly-does-happen"><strong>Let this be your wake-up call before something disastrous truly does happen.</strong></h3>



<p>Here’s what you and every parent needs to realize:</p>



<ul class="has-background" style="background-color:#e3f3fe">
<li>If you have teenagers and they’ve been on the internet unsupervised the past few years, it may not be too late to protect them and save them—<em>but you must take actions now.</em></li>



<li>If you have talked to your kids about the dangers of the internet, but done nothing more than that, you have done little to protect them.</li>



<li>If you’re concerned about invading your kids’ privacy, you’re letting the internet control their lives and opening them up to unsavory content and people.</li>



<li>If you are just starting a family, establish parental controls now and don’t lose sight of your goals and vision for your children’s futures.</li>
</ul>



<p>Let this be a wakeup call.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-parental-controls-are-needed-what-every-parent-needs-to-realize-and-respond-to"><strong>Why parental controls are needed: What every parent needs to realize and respond to.</strong></h3>



<p>It would be nice to think that the internet is like an online playground with games, movies, and plenty of friends to meet and interact with.</p>



<p>Maybe that’s what it was supposed to be like. But it’s not like that at all.</p>



<p>Here are the cold, plain facts about your kids, the internet and your world:</p>



<ol type="1" class="has-background" style="background-color:#e6f4fd">
<li>No one cares for your children’s lives and values more than you do.</li>



<li>The internet is a digital world with all types of characters in it. Good <em>and evil.</em></li>



<li>There is not a safe “kids section” or a “safe space” on the internet.</li>



<li>There are no restrictions—none at all—on the internet when it comes to content.</li>



<li>The developers of questionable apps and websites do nothing to keep your kids out. In fact, they likely do whatever they can to let your kids in. For them, it’s good for business.</li>



<li>The internet your children are using right now is unsupervised. If you’re not there to protect them, there are infact unprotected.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-these-aren-t-the-good-old-days-if-they-even-existed"><strong>These aren’t the good old days, if they even existed.</strong></h3>



<p>In general, the dynamic between parents and their kids—in general—goes something like this:</p>



<ul class="has-background" style="background-color:#e2f2fd">
<li>When kids are 5 to 8 years of age, when they’re able to spend any time away from their parents’ view or voice, parents usually give kids a set of rules, some “do’s and don’ts” behaviors:</li>



<li>Don’t go anywhere you shouldn’t.</li>



<li>Ask us permission before you go anywhere.</li>



<li>Don’t talk to strangers.</li>



<li>If you feel weird about something, stop and don’t do it.</li>



<li>If someone is making you feel uncomfortable, tell a grown up or us.</li>



<li>Come home after a certain time; or “we’ll pick you up” at a specific time.</li>
</ul>



<p>How would you add to this list? &nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Just think about how you were raised and what your family’s rules were.</li>



<li>Also, think about those kids you knew who didn’t have the same kind of rules as you.</li>



<li>Finally, ask yourself this—how well did <em>you</em> follow the rules your parents gave you.</li>
</ul>



<p>Safety and danger seemed clearer back then. Now, add the internet factor to this and everything changes.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-your-kids-don-t-need-permission-to-go-online-and-visit-any-website"><strong>Your kids don’t need permission to go online and visit any website.</strong></h3>



<p>That’s a pretty shocking revelation, isn’t it?</p>



<p>Does anyone need information on how the information has changed the world?&nbsp; Probably not. But what’s been lost in all the developments of the past 30 years is how the internet affects children.</p>



<p>Content and topics that you do not want your children (as young as 5 year’s old)to see or know about—is online right now. And easily available to them.</p>



<p>That’s the reality in this day and age.</p>



<p>Plus, your children can see it, in spite of your best wishes intentions, if they:</p>



<ol type="1">
<li>Know how to go online and get to it.</li>



<li>Happen tumble onto it.</li>



<li>See it on your computer or device; or are shown it by a friend.</li>



<li>They click on a link accidently on a text or message they receive.</li>



<li>There are no restrictions or blocks on their phones or computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-can-t-un-ring-a-bell"><strong>You can’t un-ring a bell.</strong></h3>



<ol type="1" class="has-background" style="background-color:#ddf0fb">
<li>Children as young as 5 years old, maybe even younger are being exposed to the Internet. Worse yet, they’re being exploited on the internet.</li>



<li>Teens who are on the internet several hours a day are more likely to feel negative feelings. They could experience hopelessness and suicidal thoughts.</li>



<li>It’s not just being on the internet that is problematic. It’s the nature of negative content they’re consuming or being consumed by.</li>



<li>Pediatricians say children under two years of age shouldn’t even be exposed to table, computer or &nbsp;cellphone screens.</li>
</ol>



<p>Sadly, as you probably see every day, digital devices have become a convenient babysitter for busy or distracted parents.</p>



<p>Usually those parents, who are busy working or being on their own phones, use digital devices to keep their kids occupied.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-cellphone-is-a-telephone-the-internet-is-not-a-book"><strong>A cellphone is a telephone. The internet is not a book.</strong></h3>



<p>A daily consumption of online content on social media or popular apps is not passive behavior.</p>



<p>Social media apps and virtually every website collect user data, tracks online behavior and content choices. The apps and websites also make content suggestions using algorithms. The website developer and operators keep feeding users more and more content.</p>



<p>It’s been proven that online behavior can become addictive, and shape someone’s mood, beliefs and behavior.</p>



<p>Parents take note. It’s not simply that kids maybe viewing harmful content online. They are surely spending too much of their time online, interacting with friends, watching videos, texting and counting their likes on social media.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>They are living <em>online </em>lives and losing touch with what’s real.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-parental-controls-let-a-parent-do"><strong>What parental controls let a parent do.</strong></h3>



<p>As you might have noticed, the most popular programs offer parents a baseline of parental control. Here are perhaps the most sensible or logical features:</p>



<ol type="1" class="has-background" style="background-color:#dff3ff">
<li>Prevent exposure to pornography and harmful content.</li>



<li>Catch cyberbullying in real time and stop it.</li>



<li>Blocking apps and websites</li>



<li>Location tracking in real time.</li>
</ol>



<p>That’s just a small taste of the features that are available. This comprehensive list of parent control potential features is simply a list.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-parental-control-features-you-might-look-into"><strong>Parental control features you might look into:</strong></h3>



<ol type="1" class="has-background" style="background-color:#e7f5fe">
<li>Location tracking and arrival check-in.</li>



<li>Manage and even limit screen time.</li>



<li>Controls the apps they use and monitor them by time used.</li>



<li>Block inappropriate apps and limit access.</li>



<li>Automatically block forbidden websites.</li>



<li>Monitors gaming activity.</li>



<li>Manage screen time and create custom schedules.</li>



<li>Monitor and control internet activity.</li>



<li>Receive parental alerts to online dangers.</li>

<li>Set up parental approval for kids to download apps or add contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Protect all your family’s devices.</li>



<li>Receive text and voice threat alerts on gaming sites.</li>



<li>Receive alerts when your kids try to access blocked content.</li>



<li>Get alerts when a dangerous website gets visited.</li>



<li>Filter web content and apps.</li>



<li>Get notifications if kids go onto the “dark web.”</li>



<li>Track phone calls and text (SMS) messages.</li>



<li>Get reports and alerts on what websites were visited.</li>



<li>Receive emergency messages if danger is detected.</li>



<li>Block porn and other unsuitable content.</li>



<li>Get content/message alerts on kids’ social media accounts.</li>

<li>Create and submit a “blacklist” that automatically prevents your kids from seeing inappropriate content online.</li>



<li>Custom design internet or app age restrictions, and usage rules (no gaming or internet on school nights).</li>



<li>Monitor and manage their social media usage.</li>



<li>Receive real-time alerts if they visit websites that should be off-limits.</li>



<li>Get reports and updates on their activity and history.</li>
</ol>



<p>No one parental control software program offer all or even most of the features below. However, if you are drawn to some features in particular, you can search for the parental control programs that offers more of what you seek.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-parental-controls-or-governmental-controls"><strong>Parental controls, or governmental controls?</strong></h3>



<p>If you don’t take the lead to protect your children, who will? The government? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That just may be where things are headed, and that might be a good thing. In early 2023, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley has introduced a pair of bills aimed at protecting kids online. The first calls for an age requirement of 16 in order for someone to be able to use social media.</p>



<p>Did you hear of that motion? Probably not. But it’s a least a public acknowledgment that there is a crisis when it comes to kids and the internet.</p>



<p>“Children suffer every day from the effects of social media,&#8221; Hawley said in a statement. &#8220;At best, Big Tech companies are neglecting our children’s health and monetizing their personal information. At worst, they are complicit in their exploitation and manipulation.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="553" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/girl-laptop-upset-1024x553.jpg" alt="Young girl using internet and very upset" class="wp-image-6255" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/girl-laptop-upset-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/girl-laptop-upset-300x162.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/girl-laptop-upset-768x415.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/girl-laptop-upset.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>Hawley knows big tech has a major responsibility when it comes to keeping kids safe. He also knows they’re failing in their responsibility, putting profits, popularity and usage ahead of doing what’s right.</p>



<p>He also knows that if big tech won’t “self-police,” then maybe the U.S. government has to step in to do something to take care of kids in the U.S. But his proposal begs a bigger question in all of this.</p>



<p>Where are the parents in this key issue? Have they fully grasped exactly what’s at risk?</p>



<p>Are they aware that there is a &nbsp;genuine, ongoing battle for their kids’ souls online, on social media, gaming sites and other apps?</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Attention parents: you simple cannot afford to hope for the best or, even worse perhaps, be naive.</mark></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-parents-vs-the-internet-guess-who-s-been-winning"><strong>Parents vs. the internet. Guess who’s been winning?</strong></h3>



<p>Predators, porn-site developers, scammers and blackmailers, say “bring us your kids.”</p>



<p>Maybe parents should understand that the “dark side” element of the online community wants to engage your kids in all kinds of ways.</p>



<ul class="has-background" style="background-color:#e4f3fd">
<li>Pornographers want to expose them to adult content.</li>



<li>Predators on social media want to have private conversations with them.</li>



<li>Scammers want to lure your kids into risky behaviors, then blackmail them.</li>



<li>Older kids want to introduce youngsters to new websites and apps.</li>



<li>People with different values from yours want to encourage your kids to live their own lives, express own values.</li>



<li>Social media apps don’t want to censor themselves and want your kids to grow up fast.</li>



<li>People who make money on adult-oriented apps and websites want to “sexualize” your kids.</li>



<li>Evil minded people want children to know about drugs, experience taking them and tell them where to get them.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are thousands of apps already available and many of them are adult-themed and adult oriented. You know what’s also pretty shocking? Many good kids are easily, inadvertently (yet sometimes willingly) sucked into the dark corners of the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">You might be the bad guy, in your kids’ eyes, if you wrestle control of the internet on their behalf. They certainly might not appreciate, but you hopefully need to see that touch love and decisive action has never been more important.</mark></p>



<p>The good news might be that there seems to be more attention than ever on this vital topic. Good people are on your side, and you need to know that.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-re-not-alone"><strong>You’re not alone.</strong></h3>



<p>Here is a list of organizations and professional groups that are involved in the fight against a harmful internet. They are working hard to change the country’s perspective regarding the effects of the internet, social media and technologies on children:</p>



<ul class="has-background" style="background-color:#e4f3fd">
<li>Psychologists</li>



<li>Health-and-wellness counselors</li>



<li>Child-safety organizations</li>



<li>Child-development experts</li>



<li>Police agencies</li>



<li>The FBI</li>



<li>Human trafficking task forces</li>



<li>Parent groups</li>



<li>School-based organizations</li>



<li>Cybersecurity experts</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-parents-it-s-times-to-take-control-or-let-the-internet-raise-and-mold-your-kids"><strong>Parents: It’s times to take control or let the internet raise and mold your kids.</strong></h3>



<p>Unless a parent blocks websites and apps, children may be able to join any website. It typically happens when you’re not watching or when they’re in the room or hanging with hey their friends or at school.</p>



<p>In 2023 and moving ahead, parents need to hope for the best&#8230;and prepare for the worst when it comes to keeping their kids safe online.</p>



<p>But with the tool of parental controls, you can take a bold stance and make decisive moves on creating a digital world for your kids that you design and approve of.</p>

<p>Modern communication is lightning-fast, and the internet is available all the time. Misinformation and disinformation spreads quickly, and it’s easy for even smart and aware people to be caught by it. But there is a way to keep misinformation from tricking you. By understanding disinformation and misinformation techniques, you can “inoculate” yourself against false and misleading ideas.</p>



<script async="" data-type="track" data-hash="32XDRaOgO0" data-track="183" src="https://app.fusebox.fm/embed/player.js"></script><br>



<p><em>See </em><a href="https://www.easyprey.com/being-foolproof-to-misinformation-with-sander-van-der-linden/"><em>Being Foolproof to Misinformation with Sander van der Linden</em></a><em> for a complete transcript of the Easy Prey podcast episode.</em></p>



<p>Sander van der Linden is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Cambridge in the UK. He is also the author of<em> <a href="https://amzn.to/3EAZItn">Foolproof: Why Misinformation Infects our Minds and How to Build Immunity</a></em>. Most of his work focuses on how people are influenced by information, especially false and misleading information, manipulation, and other methods of influence. His goal is to help people resist disinformation and misinformation through what he calls “psychological inoculation.”</p>



<p>Sander’s interest started by wondering why people acquire odd beliefs about the world. He was interested in superstitions, magical thinking, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/conspiracy-theories-with-dr-michael-shermer">conspiracy theories</a>, and how people get fooled by illusions and rhetorical tricks. As a child, he would try to dupe his friends and see the response. He wondered what made them think his claims were real. When the internet came along, he became interested in online deception. On a more personal level, most of his family on his mother’s side was executed by the Nazis during World War II. So he was also interested in exploring how information can influence people to do really bad things. Over the years, his interests came together under the study of psychology. He determined that influence and how people become convinced of false information would be his topic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-defining-misinformation-and-disinformation">Defining Misinformation and Disinformation</h2>



<p>When Sander gives talks, everyone has opinions about what misinformation is or is not. But Sander defines misinformation as “any information that is either false or misleading.” It’s important to include both “false” and “misleading” in the definition. There are various methods you can use to determine if something is false, like fact-checking or scientific consensus. But sometimes it’s difficult to determine if something is false. Misleading information, on the other hand, may or may not be entirely false, but it is manipulative in some way. It could be lacking context, have a particular kind of framing, or be using a misinformation technique to influence you without you realizing it. Even if the information is not false, if it’s misleading, it’s misinformation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Misinformation is stuff that’s either false or misleading. But disinformation is what I’m much more concerned about. </p>
<cite>Sander van der Linden</cite></blockquote>



<p>Disinformation is actually what Sander is more concerned about. Disinformation is misinformation with an explicit intent to deceive or do harm. It spreads false information knowingly and with an agenda, and it uses misinformation techniques to try to convince, manipulate, or trick you. It can be a political agenda (making the disinformation into propaganda), but it doesn’t have to be political. The distinction is important. Technically if a journalist makes a mistake, that’s misinformation. But everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and people usually want to correct their honest mistakes. That’s why disinformation is much more concerning.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-misinformation-techniques-online">Misinformation Techniques Online</h3>



<p>It is possible to create something that’s misleading unintentionally. Someone may, for example, write a headline that is misleading without intending to mislead people. Personally, Sander thinks the majority of times misinformation is intentional. But he tends to call it “misinformation” instead of “disinformation” when there’s no documented evidence to prove intent. He wants to give people the benefit of the doubt.</p>



<p>It can be especially difficult when it comes to online information. There is so much information online that even legitimate sources have to be sensational or clickbait-y to get views. This especially true for social media, but also true for the internet more broadly. It’s an unfortunate situation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Even credible news outlets are forced to come up with sensationalist headlines to get people to click. </p>
<cite>Sander van der Linden</cite></blockquote>



<p>Sander gives lots of advice about neutrality, objectivity, and avoiding manipulative words and language. Even though credible news outlets tend to agree, they often think, <em>That’s nice, but we’re not going to make money that way. We to get people to click.</em> We’re in an attention economy, and news outlets are fighting for people’s views. It can feel like they have to use misinformation techniques to survive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1474486935-1024x540.jpg" alt="In the attention economy, even legitimate organizations can feel like they need to use misinformation techniques to survive." class="wp-image-6235" style="width:840px;height:443px" width="840" height="443" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1474486935-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1474486935-300x158.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1474486935-768x405.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1474486935-1536x810.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1474486935-2048x1080.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p>Sander talks about a lot of these techniques in his book <em>Foolproof</em>. He’s had <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/influencer-marketing">influencers</a> come up to him and say, “I use some of these tactics. Are you saying I’m spreading misinformation?” If you define misinformation as using manipulative tactics, yes. You’re trying to influence people in ways that aren’t necessarily accurate or objective. Some people are okay with this as long as they’re transparent and ethical about it. But it can also be done to harm or confuse people. At the end of the day, it’s never a bad thing to be aware of the techniques.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Manipulative Language as a Misinformation Technique</h2>



<p>Sander and his team have looked at data online, gathered millions of observations through data scraping, and analyzed it to understand the sentiment of different kinds of content. The goal was to see what predicts content going viral and its accuracy and veracity.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The information [that] tends to go viral also tends to be less accurate. </p>
<cite>Sander van der Linden</cite></blockquote>



<p>Generally, the information that goes viral is less accurate. It’s the stuff that’s shocking, new, and attention-grabbing. It also tends to have an emotional context. Outrage, especially moral outrage, does really well online. So does fear. There are also specific words, such as “pedophile,” that are both moral and emotional. That’s why a lot of conspiracy theories invoke satanic pedophiles – it hits the nexus between negative emotions and morality.</p>



<p>Another predictor of virality is in-group/out-group language. If you write something negative about the “other side” (such as a liberal writing something nasty about conservatives, or vice versa), it’s likely to get a lot of traction on social media. This is the “perverse incentives of social media.” People learn what gets rewarded, and being negative about the other side is what gets shared and liked. The more polarizing the content, though, the less accurate it tends to be. It subtly public discourse.</p>



<p>There are a lot of things online that just aren’t true. If you do any sort of fact-checking, some things are obviously false. But obvious falsehoods aren’t the big problem. The big problem is stuff that is true here and there, but is actually manipulative and using misinformation techniques to get you emotionally worked up.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The bulk [of the problem] is the stuff that might be a little true here and there, but actually it’s quite manipulative and misleading. </p>
<cite>Sander van der Linden</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Combating Misinformation Techniques on Social Media</h2>



<p>Some models do predict “tipping points” and a doom spiral where language keeps getting harsher and more inflammatory. But there are also early detection systems being built to try to understand online discourse and see what’s taking off. It’s also hard to say at what point people disengage. Some social media companies do “ping” people. Like when <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/internet-restrictions">Netflix</a> asks if you want to keep watching, some networks will pink people and ask if they’re still interested in this. Most people actually are not, but got stuck in an echo chamber and keep seeing the same kinds of inflammatory stuff.</p>



<p>Some people think <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/a-breakdown-of-the-algorithms-that-are-running-your-life">algorithms</a> are to blame. People see disinformation, misinformation, and manipulation and react to it, so the algorithm assumes that must be the kind of content they want to see. But a few papers published recently by <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/meta-threads-twitter-killer">Meta</a> show it’s not entirely the algorithm. They tweaked their algorithms and found that it didn’t necessarily reduce polarization. But it’s a complex system. Polarity existed before social media, but algorithms can amplify existing tensions by rewarding content using misinformation techniques instead of constructive debate. Algorithms are also tied to these companies’ business models. How can we design systems that still make money but don’t promote this content? There are no easy answers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-misinformation-in-modern-times">Misinformation in Modern Times</h3>



<p>This is especially a challenge in modern times because of the speed of information. In the Roman era, it could have taken months for someone to find you and spread a rumor. Now, we can spread a rumor or pass on misinformation instantly. We’re getting input not just from regular TV and radio, but from <a href="https://www.easyprey.com/">podcasts</a>, Spotify, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-keep-your-youtube-from-getting-demonetized">YouTube</a>, Instagram, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/snapchat-search-find-someone-on-snapchat">Snapchat</a>, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/whats-so-problematic-about-tiktok">TikTok</a>, and a host of other places. There’s also less-mainstream places like <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/find-someone-on-kik">Kik</a>, Telegram, Rumble, and <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/meta-threads-twitter-killer">Threads</a>. The structure of the information environment has changed dramatically.</p>



<p>We’re being bombarded with so much information that it’s hard to even measure how much misinformation people see on a regular basis. Sander is skeptical even of estimate because it can come from dozens of platforms, from TV to social media to news sites to friends. It’s almost impossible to calculate. And as the information world becomes more fragmented, it’s also hard to reach people with corrections and debunkings of misinformation techniques.</p>



<p>The technology is also shaping itself to make us more vulnerable. On WhatsApp, for example, you can get messages in a group, so you get some group psychology elements. If the message comes from someone you trust, it adds some additional credibility that it may not warrant. YouTube is a whole different vehicle, where you can get sucked into the charisma of the creator and the audiovisual production. The unique features of each technology change how we interact with it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inoculating Yourself Against Disinformation and Misinformation Techniques</h2>



<p>As a psychologist, Sander is biased towards solutions at an individual level. When he has conversations at a larger level, there are two camps of people. One group says the individual is a distraction, because there should be more government regulation and the companies need to fix certain things. The other camp says the government shouldn’t interfere with free speech and it’s up to the individual to protect themselves from misinformation techniques. Sander has a solution that he hopes doesn’t rub anyone the wrong way – inoculation against misinformation.</p>



<p>A vaccine exposes the body to a weakened or inactivated version of a disease, which triggers the body to produce antibodies and resist future infections. It turns out that you can do the same thing with the human mind. In lots of research, Sander has found that if you expose the human mind to weakened versions of misinformation tactics and refute them in advance, people build up cognitive resistance. They develop “mental antibodies” that helped them spot future attempts to dupe them with misinformation.</p>



<p>Sander started doing this “mental inoculation” in his lab. People would come in, and he would expose them to weakened doses of potent misinformation techniques. Then he refuted the techniques and helped people identify the manipulative tactics. When exposed to misinformation and disinformation later on, they were more resistant. Just like the body needs lots of copies of potential invaders to know which proteins are healthy and which are dangerous, the mind needs to see lots of examples of misinformation to better spot it in the future.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The mind needs lots of micro-doses of what deception looks like in order to start recognizing the patterns. </p>
<cite>Sander van der Linden</cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-importance-of-inoculating-in-advance">The Importance of Inoculating in Advance</h3>



<p>Fact-checking is a great tool. But when facing a specific attack, you need to have mental defenses against misinformation techniques. Sander has found that people often have no mental defenses for misinformation in the moment. Doing the “inoculation” in advance can help you create those defenses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-929128392-1024x683.jpg" alt="Without the mental defenses from inoculation, you may have a difficult time defending against misinformation techniques." class="wp-image-6234" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-929128392-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-929128392-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-929128392-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-929128392-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-929128392-2048x1367.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>At a disinformation summit with two hundred other disinformation researchers, someone asked why people believe in flat earth. There are all sorts of reasons. For a lot of people, it’s about the conspiratorial element, not the facts. But on the cognitive level, people don’t have a lot of mental defenses. It’s unlikely that Sander would be able to convince you the earth is flat in one conversation. But he could get you to be a bit more uncertain about your beliefs if you didn’t have mental defenses. When he asked the group of two hundred who could stand up right now and explain why the world wasn’t flat, only a few people were confident that they could do it.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Most people don’t have the mental defenses ready to actually counter, argue, and resist [misinformation]. </p>
<cite>Sander van der Linden</cite></blockquote>



<p>People can throw “facts” at you about anything, and they can make it sound scientific. If you don’t have defenses, you don’t have a credible way of responding to it. That’s the idea behind inoculation. It’s important to “pre-bunk,” or debunk in advance, the misinformation techniques so you have the mental defenses to withstand an attack.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-inoculate-your-mind">How to Inoculate Your Mind</h3>



<p>It’s possible to inoculate your mind against specific falsehoods. But it’s more useful to take a more general, technique-based approach. You could learn how to counter the arguments flat earthers make, for example, but that doesn’t scale. Knowing how to refute flat earth arguments doesn’t help against a different type of misinformation. It’s more useful to inoculate yourself against the manipulation techniques themselves. Sander has a game called “Bad News” that lets you pretend to manipulate others on social media. You can go through the simulation and build up resistance to the tactics.</p>



<p>The key is not just to expose people to disinformation, but to also give them the tools to dismantle it. Otherwise, you risk just spreading the disinformation. Once someone is exposed to the weakened dose of misinformation, it’s important to deconstruct the technique. In addition, don’t assume there’s necessarily a ground truth for something. The goal of inoculation is not to teach people the “real truth.” The goal is to make people aware of misinformation techniques and manipulation tactics and let them make their own decisions about what to believe.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-example-false-dichotomies">Example: False Dichotomies</h3>



<p>False dichotomies is a technique that people love to use. The technique presents only two options, even though there are many more, and gets people to think in more extremist ways. ISIS recruitment videos, for example, claim that either you join ISIS or you’re not a good Muslim. Or the National Rifle Association tweeted, “If you want to ban AR-15s, you are an enemy of the Second Amendment.” These are false dichotomies. You can be a good Muslim who isn’t part of ISIS. And you can love guns and the Second Amendment and still think there should be a regulation of semi-automatic rifles. But dichotomies put people in a more extreme mindset by removing context and nuance.</p>



<p>You don’t even need to talk about controversial topics to get the ideas across. If you give people a template for how the manipulation works, they get better at spotting it. We should be able to agree on both sides that using these misinformation techniques is bad. If the other side uses them, call it out. But if your side uses them, you should call that out, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Misinformation Techniques and Scams</h2>



<p>Learning how to spot misinformation techniques can help you avoid disinformation, misinformation, and manipulation in media and the news. But it can also help you avoid scams. It gives you a template to realize something isn’t a reasonable interaction, and helps you be more skeptical. A lot of scam experts have said that scams are an ideal test case for Sander’s misinformation inoculation ideas, and Sander agrees.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Any domain where techniques are being used against people … you can break those down and inoculate people against them. </p>
<cite>Sander van der Linden</cite></blockquote>



<p>Just like there are many types of misinformation, there are may types of scams. Warning that they’re out there is only part of the inoculation. The more important part is the “pre-bunk” where you give people tools for how to deal with it. This is a problem Sander has with most corporate IT. They send out emails warning about phishing, but they’re not giving the weakened version of the attack. What will it look like? He encourages IT people to send out their own phishing emails, hook people, and then explain what happened. It would help people learn what to expect.</p>



<p>Scam defense started by warning people about specific types of attacks. That’s like a narrow-spectrum vaccine. It’s very helpful against that one specific attack, but when the “virus” evolves and scammers find a new vulnerability or way to attack, it’s not very useful. If we want to scale scam protection, we need broader pattern recognition. That way, people can spot the patterns even when the specific attacks change. And it’s much easier to inoculate in advance than to get people out of a scam after they’ve been caught in it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Misinformation Techniques and Marketing</h2>



<p>When some people get this knowledge, everything starts looking vaguely manipulative. Sander gets asked about marketing a lot. Emotional manipulation is a misinformation technique, but a lot of marketing uses it to sell products.</p>



<p>Sander’s field is helping people resist persuasion. He focuses especially on malicious persuasion, and a lot of marketing is not malicious. But he doesn’t see the harm if people recognize tactics and think twice before they buy. The tactic doesn’t mean the product is bad, but it levels the playing field.</p>



<p>It’s not easy to draw the line between marketing technique and manipulation. Marketers have to be careful that they’re not crossing the line and misrepresenting their products. Some manipulative marketing techniques are “tried and true” and used often. In the long term, Sander hopes we can change some of those practices.</p>



<p><a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/principles-influence-manipulation">Robert Cialdini</a> helped with Sander’s book somewhat because while Sander was uncovering the principles of manipulation, Robert was uncovering the principles of persuasion. Knowing both of these helps draw some lines. Use of experts to sell a product, for example, is a tried-and-true method. If the experts are real and honest, that’s fine. Where it gets into manipulation is when the expert isn’t being honest, has lied about their credentials, or is an expert in an unrelated subject.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-letting-marketing-make-mistakes">Letting Marketing Make Mistakes</h3>



<p>Companies can make mistakes. They may advertise a product as doing something that it turns out not to do. The key is to apologize, take responsibility, and do better. Companies who know what they’re doing, keep doing it, and don’t alert people are very different from those who recognize a mistake, are honest about it, and do better next time.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I think that a record of trustworthy behavior is what makes something or someone not explicitly manipulative. </p>
<cite>Sander van der Linden</cite></blockquote>



<p>Companies also aren’t incentivized to admit their mistakes. The threat of lawsuits leads many companies to issue non-apologies only when they have to. That’s an issue with the system. Sander is sympathetic to the idea that things need to change at a system level. Companies shouldn&#8217;t have an incentive to hide their mistakes.</p>



<p>Do we need stronger government action on social media? Sander isn’t a policy expert, and there’s an ongoing debate. But there are clear problems with the system. We need better guardrails. And we shouldn’t put the onus all on people, as people didn’t necessarily design the system. Social media companies and the government are responsible for system-level change. Some people say we need to change the system, and others say we can’t trust the system and need to change people. But that’s a false dichotomy. We can work on both systems and people.</p>

<p>Like malicious magicians, scammers use distractions and illusions to keep you from figuring out their tricks. They know if they can’t keep up the facade, you’ll realize it’s fishy. Many of the common techniques of scams – like urgency and rushing your decision – are really ways to hijack your decision-making brain and keep you focused on their lies. But by understanding how our brains work and how scammers manipulate it, you can spot their scam methods before they fool you.</p>



<script async="" data-type="track" data-hash="32XDRaOgO0" data-track="182" src="https://app.fusebox.fm/embed/player.js"></script><br>



<p><em>See </em><a href="https://www.easyprey.com/why-we-fall-for-scams-with-chris-chabris-and-dan-simons/"><em>Why We Fall for Scams with Chris Chabris and Dan Simons</em></a><em> for a complete transcript of the Easy Prey podcast episode.</em></p>



<p>Dan Simons and Christopher Chabris have jointly authored two books and multiple essays about human decision-making, distraction, and why are brains are vulnerable to scammers’ tricks, including the recent release <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3OLhw9D">Nobody’s Fool: Why We Get Taken In and What We Can Do About It</a></em>. Dan is a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois. Most of his research is around visual attention, what we notice, what we miss, and how we focus our attention. He also has a broad interest in how we think about perception and how we think about how our minds work. Chris is a cognitive scientist. He has a day job working for a health system in Pennsylvania, where he is also a professor and involved in work helping people make better decisions. His work applies ideas from decision science and cognitive psychology to improve people’s decision-making.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-they-wrote-a-book-about-scam-methods">Why They Wrote a Book About Scam Methods</h2>



<p>Dan and Chris started thinking about this topic a long time ago. They finished thier first book together over a decade ago. For their second book, they started by gathering content and generating ideas of what they wanted to write about. Most of what they came up with had to do with deception in general. It took them a while to find a way to organize all the ideas into a connected, cohesive book.</p>



<p>They found the connection when they realized that across all the different domains they looked at – chess, art, science, sports, and more – scams, cons, deception, and self-deception all had common characteristics. The scam methods relied on thought patterns that normally work well, but can be distorted by people trying to deceive us. Information that we find appealing can be hijacked to lead us down the wrong path.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>[Scams] rely on the same sorts of thought patterns that we tend to use very effectively most of the time, but they get distorted at times by people trying to decieve us. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stories-of-deception">Stories of Deception</h3>



<p>One of the interesting things they found when trying to structure the book was that all the stories about cons were engaging and entertaining. They have a narrative structure – which is why movies about big cons are popular. There are hundreds of news stories, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/the-tinder-swindler-victim-story">documentaries</a>, podcasts, and more about these types of deceptions.</p>



<p>One case that comes to mind for Chris is his father. His father lived to be ninety-seven years old. Sometimes late in life, he got a call from a guy pretending to be a tech support person who needed to help him fix his internet. Chris’s father was pretty savvy and cognitively intact until the end, so he hung up on them. His father was never victimized, but Chris could easily see how he or someone like him could have been.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-1024x683.jpg" alt="We've all heard stories about scams - so why are the same scam methods still tricking us?" class="wp-image-6225" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1352168896-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Chances are high that you’ve heard a story about a scam, or at the very least watched a movie featuring one. But very few of these stories focus on why people get fooled. Why do some scam methods lead really smart, highly-educated people into scams? Stories of these kinds of cons are everywhere. And yet we’re seeing more and more news about scams and cons in all sorts of areas. Why aren’t we learning from all the movies and the true tales that end up in articles or podcasts? Dan and Chris wanted to explore this idea – and try to make us more aware of the risks in our own brains.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Whether that means there’s more and more [scams] happening, or we’re just leaning about more and more of it, it seems to be such an issue of great importance that it is worth diving into. </p>
<cite>Chris Chabris</cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scam-methods-in-movies-and-reality">Scam Methods in Movies and Reality</h3>



<p>The scam methods you see in movies about great cons are somewhat accurate. The fictional con artists exploit the same kinds of cognitive tendencies that make us vulnerable in real life. Most of the scam methods you see on the screen also work in real life.</p>



<p>What isn’t realistic is the intricacy of the plan and how everything depends on a precise sequence and exact timing. You need that kind of tension to make a compelling movie. And while some scams do run down to the wire to avoid getting caught, such as Bernie Madoff’s <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/ponzi-schemes-with-steve-weisman">Ponzi scheme</a>, most of them are much more flexible and don’t require precise timing.</p>



<p>Even huge cons like Madoff’s scheme, Theranos, and other long-running cons don’t need that level of precision. But they are good examples to think about because they draw on a variety of scam methods to keep going. They exploit the same metal habits and use other techniques available. Smaller scams may only need to rely on one or two scam methods, but for something to last as long as these examples, they need to take advantage of every trick in the book.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-scammer-who-targeted-academics">The Scammer Who Targeted Academics</h2>



<p>At one point, Chris and Dan were targeted by the same scammer. This was nearly twenty years ago. Chris was a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard, and he was contacted out of the blue by someone. This man seemed to know who Chris was and have a lot of connections in common. He told Chris about a person who had an interesting neurological problem and wondered if Chris was interested in doing a case study. Chris was interested. They had a number of phone calls back and forth and Chris was working to make the study happen when eventually, contact stopped.</p>



<p>Around the same time, Dan was contacted by the same person claiming to be interested in the work he was doing on visual perception. He was interested in illusions and wanted to find a way to make Dan’s research more well-known. Just like Chris, this man pitched a collaboration. At one point, he asked Dan to help work on his website, which Dan declined. They had multiple calls and emails over several months before contact stopped.</p>



<p>It was only very recently that Dan and Chris learned what happened. The man was a small-scale scammer. Most often he convinced people to let him sell their rare books and then never gave them the money. He affiliated himself with high-profile researchers and universities, and people kept him around thinking everyone else knew him even though nobody really did.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-easy-way-to-avoid-being-scammed">One Easy Way to Avoid Being Scammed</h3>



<p>This story illustrates one easy way some people can avoid being scammed. That method is to look up the person talking to you! Check their credentials and look up whether they have been convicted, criminally sued, professionally sanctioned, or anything else. A history of speeding tickets may not be relevant. But a lawsuit or conviction for scams, fraud, or relevant crimes definitely is. Surprisingly, many people don’t think to check. Scammers don’t usually change their scam methods. If they’ve done it before, chances are good that they’ll do it again.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Have they done the same thing before that they might do to you? That’s a really basic question to ask. </p>
<cite>Chris Chabris</cite></blockquote>



<p>For the scammer who reached out to Chris and Dan, they could have seen through him specifically by checking his credentials. He was academic-adjacent, but didn’t have the kind of credentials you would expect for someone in a research field. Scammers targeting academics often use scam methods to pass themselves off as wealthy connected patrons, which this scammer did sometimes. But he was faking a lot of his resources, too. His main tool was talking his way into things. He was more of a recreational or hobbyist scammer than a professional, so he didn’t have convictions to be suspicious. But the credentials would have been a warning sign if Dan or Chris had checked.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-scam-methods-exploit-your-focus">How Scam Methods Exploit Your Focus</h2>



<p>Humans only have the ability to focus on a select amount of information in front of us. This is what we commonly call “paying attention.” When you’re focusing on something, you can process information more efficiently and get more out of it. But it also means you have less focus for anything else. If you’re focused on what’s on your computer screen, you may not notice things happening elsewhere in the room.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>A good con artist, a good scammer, will know that if they can get you to focus on one thing, you may not notice something else. </p>
<cite>Chris Chabris</cite></blockquote>



<p>If a scammer can use their scam methods to get you to focus on what they want, they know you’ll be less likely to notice what they’re doing behind the scenes. It’s like a magic show. The magician directs your attention to what they want you to pay attention to and away from the slight of hand that makes the effect happen.</p>



<p>The challenge here is that focus is not a bad thing. The ability to focus on one thing and exclude everything else is really important and helpful in our everyday life. It only becomes a problem when scam artists exploit and manipulate it to their benefit.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-time-pressure-as-a-scam-method">Time Pressure as a Scam Method</h3>



<p>One of the most commonly-used scam methods is time pressure. It could be an “exploding offer” – something fantastic that will expire in a very short time. Or with <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/irs-scam">IRS scams</a> or other <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/social-security-scams-impostor-scams">impostor scams</a>, the scammer may claim that the police are on their way to arrest you and will be there in half an hour, but if you can pay your debt before they arrive they’ll call the police off.</p>



<p>Time pressure is a scam method that manipulates your focus. If the scammer can get you stuck in the moment, or in a rush to deal with the situation before the police arrive, it can be hard to step back and consider what you’re actually being told. Most of us know that the IRS will never call you and demand gift cards. But if the scammer can get you to focus only on what they’re saying and the time pressure, it may not even occur to you to ask what’s going on or if the request makes sense.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Time pressure is, in a way, a tactic to get you to focus. You don’t have time to consult alternate sources of information or think about what information is missing. </p>
<cite>Chris Chabris</cite></blockquote>



<p>Many other scam techniques, like staying on the phone with you while you drive to the store to buy gift cards, are just more attempts to manipulate your focus. They know if they stop talking to you, you might start to think about whether gift cards are actually a reasonable way to pay for this or if it’s normal for the Social Security Administration to threaten you with arrest. Time pressure, rapid-fire talking, and many other scam techniques are meant to keep your focus on the scammer, not what’s really happening.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-principle-of-prediction">The Principle of Prediction</h2>



<p>You’ve probably heard of confirmation bias before. With confirmation bias, people seek out evidence to confirm their expectations, beliefs, or conclusions about something. The principle of prediction is similar, but it’s also something that scam methods can exploit to swindle us.</p>



<p>“Prediction” refers to the fact that we tend to be much less critical of new information that matches what we expect. Most of us are really good at critical thinking when it comes to things we disagree with. If someone tells us something we absolutely don’t believe, we can tear it apart. But it’s much harder to find flaws in an argument when it’s something we believe or expect. Scammers know this, and they exploit prediction in their scam methods. They give you what you’re expecting or hoping for so it’s harder to counter it.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We’re capable of applying logic really effectively when it’s something we disagree with, but we tend not to apply it as systematically when it’s something we agree with. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-prediction-works">How Prediction Works</h3>



<p>For example, it’s normally a good thing to trust people that you know. The longer you’ve known them, the better you know them, and the better you know them the more you can trust them. That’s how it works normally. But these days we have social media and “online friends.” When those friends spread information to us, our brains view it with a little extra credibility because it came from someone we know. Even if that credibility isn’t warranted – for example, your friend retweeted something from a complete stranger – we still view it as a bit more trustworthy. This creates pathways that scam methods can exploit.</p>

<p>This tendency usually works really well. Most people don’t get scammed or conned all the time. The moment-to-moment risk is pretty low. Most of the time, these “shortcuts” or mental simplifications work really well for us. There’s a tendency to frame them as biases or flaws, but they’re not. We have these tendencies because in most cases, they work. But they can be hijacked for nefarious purposes or lead us astray if we assume they always work. That’s where it becomes a challenge.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These are things that work really, really well most of the time and that can be hijacked for the wrong purposes. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-commitments-and-assumptions">Commitments and Assumptions</h2>



<p>In this context, a “commitment” is an assumption that we make and that we hold to strongly. We often don’t realize we’ve made these commitments or hold them when we’re making a decision. The challenge with commitments is that if we accept them as inherently true, logic can lead us to all kinds of absurd conclusions because we have to rationalize other things to keep believing our commitment.</p>



<p>NXIVM was a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/mlm-scams-manipulation">multi-level marketing</a> organization, front for criminal activity, and arguable cult founded by a guy who got himself in a book of records as the world’s smartest man. One early member wrote in a memoir that she knew he was the world’s smartest man, so whatever he said had to be smart. If you keep in mind that you’re dealing with the world’s smartest man, you could wind up agreeing to a lot of crazy stuff because it’s coming from “the world’s smartest man.”</p>



<p>It’s a simple example, but cults tend to happen because of an idea that someone is infallible, speaks or god, is really a genius, or has some other reason for authority. Once people believe that commitment, they can rationalize all sorts of things from that premise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-terrible-ideas-from-commitments">Terrible Ideas from Commitments</h3>



<p>Commitments are used in scam methods often. It’s common to build up commitment over time and start with small things that you agree with. Once they get you to buy into the small commitment, it’s easier to build bigger, more unreasonable beliefs on top by convincing you that you’re staying committed to those initial good ideas.</p>



<p>It’s important to remember that people who’ve made commitments usually have internally consistent logic. From the outside, their beliefs and actions may look crazy or disconnected from reality. Or it may seem like they’re intentionally ignoring something that seems very obvious to you. But they’ve built everything around certain commitments. To them, everything seems coherent and logical because it supports those commitments. And it can be very difficult to step back and question those fundamental assumptions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It might look completely unhinged from reality. But … if they can get you to throw out all the other stuff and accept that one premise, you can be acting completely logically, completely reasonably, given that premise. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-see-the-bigger-picture-and-spot-scam-methods">How to See the Bigger Picture and Spot Scam Methods</h2>



<p>For commitments specifically, part of the problem is that we’re not aware of the assumptions we’re making. If you were in NXIVM, you might not always be thinking about how your leader is the smartest man in the world. But you may have internalized it and act from that assumption without thinking about it.</p>



<p>It’s important to take the time to ask what you’re assuming about a situation. Even when not trying to spot scam methods, it’s a good thinking tool in general. Ask yourself if there was any information that would get you to change your mind, and if there’s anything you believe that would change anything if you were wrong. You may not be open to having your beliefs changed. But you might be.</p>



<p>One of scammers’ most important scam methods is to keep you from asking questions. They’ll do anything they can to keep you from talking to anyone else or getting any other perspectives. Some scammers will get aggressive or try to browbeat you if you ask questions. The best thing you can do iis ask someone else. When working on their book, Dan and Chris found many stories where someone saw the situation by accident and pointed out that it was a scam. Once the bubble was pricked and the would-be victim had an opportunity to reevaluate their beliefs, many of them realized it was a scam. Ask someone outside the situation what they think is going on. They might see the scam methods for what they are.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Having somebody else look at it who might have different motivations, different desires, might see through it and say, “Okay, wait. That’s too good to be true,” and force you to think about it for a second. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-an-increase-in-scams-or-in-scam-awareness">An Increase in Scams or in Scam Awareness?</h2>



<p>We are definitely hearing more about scams. But is this increase because there has been an increase in scams or because there is more <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/scam-protection-awareness-isnt-enough">awareness</a> about them? It’s really hard to tell. We can look at statistics, but those won’t give us a solid answer, either – statistics could show an increase because people are more comfortable reporting it now.</p>



<p>As new technology and industries are created and aren’t regulated, it creates more spaces that are ripe for scams. There’s been so many things happening with <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/crypto-scam-recovery-fraud">cryptocurrency</a>, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-ai-and-copyright-law">AI</a>, and other new technology, that it’s possible scams are on the rise just because there are so many more technologies to scam with. It could also be because there has been more reporting and documentation about it lately and more people are willing to come forward about being scammed.</p>



<p>Technology also makes it easier to use scam methods at scale. Even in the last twenty years we’ve seen the rise of large-scale industrial scamming. Even the classic <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/419-scam">Nigerian Prince</a> and advance fee scams are easier to pull off now because of email. But people aren’t changing as fast as technology is. Scam methods are still going to capitalize on the same tools to trick us. We’ll see the same methodologies, just in new contexts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Every new advance is going to lead to new variants of these [scams] that are more sophisticated, but they all rely on the same principles. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-scams">The Future of Scams</h2>



<p>Dan thinks AI and large language models are an interesting case because they make it easier to spread misinformation at scale. It could even take the scammer out of part of the scamming process to make it less costly for scammers. At the very least, it will make it easier to use scam methods at scale.</p>



<p>At the very least, Dan hopes that people will realize tools like <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/openai-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> and other large language models speak with absolute certainty but have no connection with truth. They might generate reasonable answers most of the time, but unreasonable or false answers sound just as good and confident. As people start to realize these models aren’t representing truth, Dan hopes it causes people to start questioning all messages, even if they’re not driven by AI.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It should take some work to have an opinion. You should have to gather some evidence to support why you believe something. </p>
<cite>Dan Simons</cite></blockquote>



<p>If we could be deceived easily by a large language model, we could just as easily be decieved by a person. It might make people more questioning and less accepting of content they receive.</p>



<p>That’s also Dan and Chris’s best advice for spotting and avoiding scam methods. You can’t just trust – trust, but verify. Be willing to be a bit uncertain. Don’t accept things at face value and don’t decide to believe without doing a little research, even if it sounds logical and reasonable. Do more checking and ask more questions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Accept less, check more. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discord-snapchat-and-instagram-each-have-a-dark-corner">Discord, Snapchat and Instagram each have a dark corner. </h3>



<p>If you’re a parent listen closely. No matter how good, responsible and trustworthy your kids are, or you think they are, trouble is nearby. You have NO way of knowing what they’re doing online, especially with their phones.</p>



<p>One of the biggest issues for parents is the peer pressure their kids are under to have a phone.</p>



<p>But it’s not only the kids’ fault—many parents want their children to have a phone to keep in touch, and that’s a two-way street. They want to know when their kids need something and check up on them as well.</p>



<p>And for kids, they now have a way to stay in touch with their friends, too and not feel left out. (They like that aspect of having a phone more than keeping in touch with their parents or guardians.)</p>



<p>That’s what smartphones are and were supposed to be for—in a perfect world. Keeping in touch. But we don’t live in a perfect world.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-media-is-where-kids-live-and-where-predators-lurk"><strong>Social media is where kids live, and where predators lurk.</strong></h3>



<p>In 2002 a survey was done by the Pew Research Center that showed some startling statistics.</p>



<ul class="has-background" style="background-color:#f0f9ff">
<li>Almost half of teenagers aged 13-17 reported they are online almost constantly throughout the day.</li>



<li>The platforms they’re using aren’t Twitter or Facebook, like their parents use. It’s YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and a slew of others where their age group interacts.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are also a long list of social media sites that their parents aren’t on, don’t use or even know anything about.</p>



<p>That’s where the danger lies.</p>



<p>And let’s not forget, there are hundreds of apps for playing games, sharing photos, making new friends and posting videos.</p>



<p>Here are three well-known social media platforms that are readily available to kids (and predators) to know about. They could easily land them into trouble, according to the website, <a href="https://security.org">security.org</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-snapchat-the-potential-problem-it-lets-kids-send-messages-that-disappear-after-a-day"><strong>Snapchat:</strong> The potential problem: It lets kids send messages that disappear after a day.</h3>



<p>There’s one thing that ALL parents have in common—they were once kids too. Remember that there were times that you probably didn’t let your parents know exactly what you were up to. Or maybe you even lied about where you were, what you were doing, or who you were with.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It’s part of growing up for most kids and the rise of social media has taken that to incredible levels.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>So, a teenager could post a message with a candid photo to a new friend and 1) not know it’s actually a predator or scammer on the other end, and 2) think that because they deleted the photo, no one will see it.</p>



<p>Wrong. In the wrong hands, a child or teen could be blackmailed, exploited and bullied.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discord-a-whole-lot-of-craziness-going-on"><strong>Discord. A whole lot of craziness going on.</strong></h3>



<p>What is <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>? It’s a social media platform that allows people to communicate in real time on a range of topics—actually, virtually any topic. Supposedly it sprung up from the idea of Slack, the communication platform used by companies: In that case, the common interest was a business industry.</p>



<p>It could help kids develop good communication skills with other people and allow them to make and build offline relationships with people who share a mutual interest. But it can be more—a lot more—not so good.</p>



<p>In Discord lingo, communities are called <strong>servers</strong>, and many of them are outright not intended for younger eyes&#8230;and you likely wouldn’t like your kids to be able to join and hop right in. In a test, people from <a href="https://security.org">Security.org</a> joined discord, put their age at 15 and could easily join an adult-themed community. There were unsavory servers as well, including some on hacking, identity theft, drugs and more.</p>



<p>Is that what you’d want your 11-year-old to stumble into?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-instagram-a-real-eye-opener"><strong>Instagram. A real eye opener.</strong></h3>



<p>Everyone seems to be on Instagram, right? There are cute cat and funny dog videos, influencers and videos on every topic. But there’s also a dark underside to the platform that a dark community is well aware of.</p>



<p>A Wall Street Journal article in 2023 revealed that there are corners in Instagram where some unsavory subscribers hang out, including pedophiles. These pedophiles are daring enough to share pictures and exchange tips and advice on their favorite topics. Even if your kids don’t come across these people, it doesn’t mean that these people might not lure your kids with flattering messages or approach them with stark and disturbing images.</p>



<p>But your child doesn’t have to visit Instagram’s shady alleys to find content you’d find objectionable. There is so much content (it’s the fourth-most popular app out there) and Instagram allows pornographic contents: Yes, supposedly there are age filters and such, but 1) they don’t always work, 2) strangers may still be able to view your kids’ posts, and 3) Instagram’s own monitoring and filtering seems to strangely not be working as advertised. In other words, it seems these platforms are sometimes quite okay skirting the lines of doing what’s right for children and parents.</p>



<p>And there’s this. Many safety measures that social media platforms put in place don’t prevent kids from seeing what they shouldn’t and don’t stop them getting to content they are driven to see.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kids-will-be-kids-predators-will-be-predators"><strong>Kids will be kids. Predators will be predators.</strong></h3>



<p>As a parent who was once a child and a teenager, do you remember when you were determined to do or see what you really wanted to see? These days, with social media and all their logarithms and now augmented intelligence, kids don’t stand a chance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Not only are they led by their hormones, peer pressure, and young, still-developing minds, but they are also bombarded by suggestions and images fed to them by the platforms themselves.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>They don’t need to be exposed to all there is to see online. Once seen, it is hard to be unseen.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wanted-parental-intervention-needed-parental-controls"><strong>Wanted: Parental intervention. Needed: Parental controls.</strong></h3>



<p>If you’ve made it to this end of the article you’ve gotten the message loud and clear. Parents and guardians have to step up and protect their kids.</p>



<p>No one else will do it and, in reality, parents should be the ones to step up. </p>



<p>You’re not alone. There is plenty of great information online on the topic, which has become more urgent and louder. There are also software programs and apps available that parents can use to protect their kids.</p>



<p>To learn more and see what the top programs are to help parents keep their children safe online and safe from predators, read our article on this important topic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you think about it, the technology we have around us today is pretty incredible. From generative AI tools like <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-get-banned-from-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> to <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/long-lost-relative-scams-other-issues-with-dna-testing">DNA testing</a>, so many technological abilities that are normal now would have been something out of a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/classic-80s-movies-that-accurately-predicted-the-future">sci-fi film</a> or a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/technology-from-james-bond-movies-that-exists-now">James Bond</a> movie thirty years ago. But just like in science fiction, new technologies come with new risks. If you have wifi-connected appliances or “smart” gadgets on the Internet of Things (IoT), these IoT devices are at risk from attackers. And on an even larger scale, new technology has opened more opportunities for cyber warfare.</p>



<script async="" data-type="track" data-hash="32XDRaOgO0" data-track="181" src="https://app.fusebox.fm/embed/player.js"></script><br>



<p><em>See </em><a href="https://www.easyprey.com/securing-iot-and-cyber-warfare-with-mikko-hypponen/"><em>Securing IoT and Cyber Warfare with Mikko Hypponen</em></a><em> for a complete transcript of the Easy Prey podcast episode.</em></p>



<p>Mikko Hypponen is an old-school <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/hacking-basics">hacker</a> from Helsinki, Finland. He started programming as a teenager, sold his first programs when he was seventeen, and reverse-engineered malware for the first time in 1991, when he was twenty-one. He has spent the past thirty-two years tracking online attackers, finding out where <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/organized-cybercrime-research">organized cybercrime</a> gangs come from, and tracking government cyberattacks, especially from <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/hacking-101-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-russian-hacker">Russia</a>. In addition, he has written for the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wired</em>, and <em>Scientific American</em>, lectured at the Universities of Oxford, Stanford, and Cambridge, and sits on an advisory board with Europol.</p>



<p>Mikko’s mother got into computers in the 1960s, when very few people were working with computers. During the defining years of his childhood, she brought home computer punch cards and stories of working with technology. When he was sixteen years old, she told him, “Mikko, you should study telecommunications. Telecommunications is the future.” This was before mobile phones were common, so the advice was prescient. If you had told Mikko back then that eventually everyone would have a computer in their pocket, he wouldn’t have believed you. But his mother was right.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-iot-devices-and-security">IoT Devices and Security</h2>



<p>IoT devices, also known as “smart” devices, are quite popular. And there’s a good reason for that. Though some smart devices seem <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/idiotic-smart-gadget">useless or unnecessary</a>, many others can benefit our lives. For example, Mikko doesn’t have a smart fridge himself. But he has seen people out grocery shopping who can’t remember if they need milk, so they pull out their phone to see what’s in the fridge. Those kinds of features make IoT devices helpful in everyday situations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-1024x683.jpg" alt="IoT devices can be very useful in life." class="wp-image-6207" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1136317353-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I understand perfectly well why people have smart doorbells or smart fridges. &#8230; The problem really is that nobody configures these correctly.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>But IoT devices also come with a lot of security risks. Part of that is because in the marketplace, the cheapest product wins. For vendors building an appliance, there’s no incentive to make it secure. If they invest the time and money to make their smart fridge more secure than their competitors, in the end they’ve just made the product more expensive.</p>



<p>Another problem is that nobody configures their IoT devices correctly. Nobody plans to update the firmware on their refrigerator. And when people go shopping for new appliances, they ask questions about the color, or the size, or the price. Nobody asks questions about security. That’s a large problem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-regulation-for-iot-device-security">Regulation for IoT Device Security</h3>



<p>In many ways, the lack of security in IoT devices is a market failure. Even though security is important, the market doesn’t reward it. The way we typically try to fix market failures is through regulations. Mikko is generally not a fan of regulation. But if we’re going to regulate something, this would be a good place to do it.</p>



<p>If you buy a washing machine and it catches fire in the middle of the night and burns your house down, the vendor who built that washing machine is liable for damages. But if that same washing machine has weak security, a hacker can get access to your <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/network-security-for-dummies-guarding-your-home-network">home network</a>, and you wake up to every device in your house infected with <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/the-dangerous-evolution-of-ransomware">ransomware</a>, the vendor who left the security so weak isn’t liable for anything. Regulation could make the vendor liable. That would provide incentive for vendors to build IoT devices that are more secure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Secure Your IoT Devices</h2>



<p>IoT devices have risks. But that doesn’t mean you can’t use them if you want to be secure. There are steps you can take to manage your IoT devices to be more secure. Mikko’s first piece of advice to anyone with any kind of “smart” device: Read the manual!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Many of these hackable devices wouldn&#8217;t be hackable if the consumers would simply read the manual.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>Lots of information comes with every product you buy. If you buy an IoT device, the manual probably has instructions to change the default password, configure the security, prevent outsiders from accessing the controls, or even how to segment your whole network so someone who accessed your smart gadget can’t access any of your computers. The problem is that nobody reads the manual.</p>



<p>Vendors should have some responsibility for IoT device security. But consumers have to take some responsibility, as well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-malware-for-smart-devices-is-increasing">Malware for Smart Devices is Increasing</h3>



<p>When Mikko looked at internet traffic over the <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/ipv4-parts">IPv4</a> space, especially malicious traffic, he found some surprising changes. In the past, malicious traffic was mostly malware for Windows devices. But it isn’t anymore. Most malware traffic now is <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/10-reasons-why-you-should-switch-to-linux">Linux</a>-based.</p>



<p>The reason for this is IoT malware. There are plenty of IoT devices running on Linux. And much of this malware is very simple. Known as “Mirai” malware, it tries to infect devices by trying known weak username and password combinations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Hackers Want Access To Your IoT Devices</h2>



<p>You might be thinking, “I can understand why a hacker would want to get into my laptop or my wifi network. But what could they do with my washing machine or my refrigerator?” And the answer is, a lot! IoT devices can be used to “pivot” through your home network – if it’s not properly configured, a hacker could get into your <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/smart-light-bulbs-wave-of-the-future-or-security-threat">smart lightbulb</a> and use that to attack your laptop or phone. These attacks, though, are most commonly done against businesses, not home networks.</p>



<p>But even if a hacker isn’t using your IoT device to get into your other devices, there are other things they can do with it. A lot of people think there’s not much computing power available to steal from these devices. But there is more than you would think. Mikko regularly sees security cameras that have been taken over by <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/spam-botnet">botnets</a> that hackers use to send malware, spam, and scams to others. They can also be used to launch <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/types-of-cyber-attacks">“denial of service” attacks</a>, which can be very powerful if there’s several thousand IoT devices behind it. Russia used botnets for denial of service attacks against a recent NATO summit in Lithuania.</p>



<p>Another thing that hackers can use your IoT devices for is <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-primer">cryptocurrency</a> mining. There are cryptocurrencies designed so you don’t need a dedicated device to mine them. Hackers can put crypto mining software on your smart device and create money for themselves – while you pay for the electricity and the bandwidth it needs to run.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-you-can-do-before-and-after-you-re-compromised">What You Can Do Before (and After) You&#8217;re Compromised</h2>



<p>Even the smartest people can make mistakes. Anyone, even security experts, can be anxious, in a hurry, or not paying attention. That includes Mikko. Mikko works in security, but he’s had his <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/managing-credit-cards-with-sara-rathner">credit card</a> number stolen twice and has accidentally infected several computers with malware.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I completely understand why people get infected or why people get fooled. When you are tired, when you&#8217;re anxious, when you&#8217;re in a hurry, we all make mistakes. I make mistakes.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>Before your computer or IoT device is compromised, the number one rule is <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/backup">backups</a>. You have to have some kind of recovery method. What that is differs depending on whether you’re backing up a business device or a personal one. But especially for home users, a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/the-safest-cloud-storage-apps-in-2021">cloud</a>-based backup is a great option. Apple, for example, puts most things in their <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-secure-your-icloud-account-from-spies">iCloud</a> by default, so backups are practically automatic. And even if the current version is corrupted, companies can roll back to a previous version and recover your data.</p>



<p>But what if the compromise has already happened? The hackers have taken over your IoT devices, or your laptop is riddled with ransomware. Mikko’s top tip for this applies to any crisis situation. Whether you think you’ve been hacked, you got scammed, or you got a phone call or an email about something important, you can apply this tip. It’s very simple: Take a break. Step out of the room or take a walk around the block if you can. Clear your head and reconsider what’s happening. Think it through before you take any action. What’s the real information? Are you being tricked? Did you make a mistake? Who should you call for help about this? Acting without thinking it through could make the situation even worse. Take time to think first.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-russia-and-cyber-war">Russia and Cyber War</h2>



<p>Finland shares about nine hundred miles of border with Russia, and both of Mikko’s grandfathers fought Russians in World War II. Because of this, Finnish cybersecurity companies pay attention to what’s happening in Russia – not just the cybercrime gangs, but also government actors. There have been plenty of attacks by the government over the last fifteen years, most of which were espionage. But now, things are becoming more concrete. They’re not just doing espionage with cyber tools, they’re also doing sabotage.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>These should be called cyber weapons and this should be called cyber war.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>War has expanded from its original domain. Thousands of years ago, we only had wars fought on land. Now, if you look at the war between Russia and Ukraine, they are fighting in five domains: Land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. And the technology that allows these new domains allows spying and espionage, which is crucial. In World War II, the only way to find out about troop movements and gatherings was to send someone over there to look. The Russia-Ukraine war still uses tanks and people in ditches with assault rifles. But now tech allows both sides to send drones and satellites to track troops, triangulate radio signals, and track mobile phones. It’s a huge difference.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cyber-attacks-are-the-game-changer">Cyber Attacks are the Game-Changer</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Technology is shaping war in many ways, but the real game changer is cyber attacks themselves.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>Russia has been targeting Ukraine with cyberattacks for the past seven years, both trying to gain access and information and to destroy things. When war broke out in February last year, there were days-long waits at the border because of a successful Russian cyberattack. They had wiped all the Ukrainian border control computers. The borders were open, but everything had to be done by pen and paper so it was much slower. That’s what normal modern cyber war looks like.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-1024x683.jpg" alt="Cyber warfare sounded like science fiction decades ago - now it's happening." class="wp-image-6208" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1406786132-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Ukraine has become the best company in Europe at defending against Russian governmental cyberattacks. It’s because they have been targeted by these attacks for so long. When you do something over and over again, you become an expert in it. Mikko is in the military reserves in Finland, and when he goes in for refresher training they give him a keyboard because that’s what he’s best at. They rehearse and play war games, imagining what they would do in various scenarios. But Ukraine isn’t rehearsing. They’ve been fighting a cyber war against Russia for years, so they have the expertise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-cyber-war">The Future of Cyber War</h3>



<p>War is shaped by technology. Whatever the next domain of war will be will also be shaped by technology. Thirty years ago, cyber war sounded like science fiction. Whatever the next domain of war is will sound like science fiction to us right now, too.</p>



<p>Mikko isn’t sure what it will be, but he can make a guess. It may be nano warfare. With advancements in nanotechnology, armies could disperse aerosols over battlefields that are full of nanobots. Those nanobots could get into enemy soldiers’ bloodstreams, travel to their brains, and change their thoughts.</p>



<p>Does that sound like science fiction? Absolutely. But thirty years ago the idea of cyber war also sounded like science fiction, and it’s happening now.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-in-cyber-war-malware-and-security">AI in Cyber War, Malware, and Security</h2>



<p>Mikko started working with machine learning systems for cybersecurity products in 2005. That was almost two decades ago. All that time, he has been waiting for enemies to catch up and start using the same AI and machine learning technology. Mostly, he’s still waiting. We have seen <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/deep-fakes-with-lonnie-waugh">deep fakes</a> and the first malware written in Python with the help of <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/openai-chatgpt">GPT</a> AI tools. But we have yet to see it used for the most dangerous potential option – fully automated malware.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>What really is still missing, which could happen any day, is complete automation of malware campaigns.</p>
<cite>Mikko Hypponen</cite></blockquote>



<p>Many security companies can use machine learning technology to attract attacks with bait, get a sample, run it in virtual systems, analyze it, and build detection systems in a matter of minutes. But right now, attackers are still working manually. They write new ransomware, craft <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/detect-phishing">malicious emails</a>, register <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/domain-name">domain names</a>, and send spam at human speeds, while we’re defending at machine speeds. When the attackers shift into full automation, it will be a whole new challenge. If they can compromise your IoT devices and put malware on your computers just as fast as we can defend them, we don’t really know who’s going to win. At that point, the best thing to defend you from bad AI is good AI.</p>

<p>Personal information about you is probably publicly available online, right now. Sites known as data brokers gather up info about you and build a profile with your name, address, phone number, and other details. Sometimes they even have photos of you.</p>



<p>Sounds like a major invasion of privacy, right? Technically, it’s legal for data brokers to do this. Fortunately, it’s also legal for you to request that your information be taken down. You can submit requests to each data broker one at a time or you can use a service to help you remove your information from the web all at once.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/110-1024x640.jpg" alt="Woman sitting in front of a computer" class="wp-image-6204" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/110-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/110-300x188.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/110-768x480.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/110.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-5-best-services-for-removing-your-info-from-the-internet">The 5 Best Services for Removing Your Info from the Internet</h2>



<p>We rounded up the five best companies for online data removal. They all specialize in getting your info removed from people search sites. But some of them also help you delete profiles on marketing, recruitment, and financial sites, too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-incogni">Incogni</h3>



<p><a href="https://incogni.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=home">Incogni</a> is a data removal service developed by the VPN company <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/vpn-reviews/surfshark-review">Surfshark</a> — so you know they take internet privacy seriously. When you sign up for Incogni, you provide your information and give over power of attorney, so the service can monitor for your personal information and contact data brokers on your behalf.</p>



<p>Incogni is one of the most comprehensive data removal services available, as it covers 180 data brokers in its database (more than most competitors). It also has a friendly user-interface and is easy to navigate. The company is pretty transparent about its practices as well. One of the main downsides to Incogni is that you don’t really have a way to confirm if the data has been removed after a request is sent.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Easy to set up</li>



<li>Sleek user interface</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Can’t easily confirm data removal</li>



<li>Only covers US, Canada, UK, Switzerland, and EU</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Price</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>$6.49 per month</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deleteme">DeleteMe</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-558992-13790517?sid=5-tools-remove-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DeleteMe</a> is an easy-to-use data deletion service that will help you get rid of information on data broker sites. It can help you delete existing information about you as well as submit requests for future takedowns (since data brokers can keep collecting data on you and start a new profile after you submit a request to delete).</p>



<p>One of the features of DeleteMe is that it’s a set-it-and-forget-it service. Once you sign up and provide your information, the DeleteMe service does all the work. You’ll also get periodic reports about what the service has found when monitoring for your information.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Quarterly reports</li>



<li>Easy-to-use interface</li>



<li>Free tutorials for DIY removal</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>You might have to provide ID documents for DeleteMe to remove info from data broker sites</li>



<li>Reports don’t link to brokers</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Price</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>$129 per year</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dataseal">DataSeal</h3>



<p><a href="https://dataseal.io/sites-we-cover?via=wimia-5-tools-remove-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DataSeal</a> covers 136 sites that collect information, including data brokers, people searches, and public records. You can take a look at exactly <a href="https://dataseal.io/sites-we-cover?via=wimia-5-tools-remove-data">which sites their service includes</a> before you decide to purchase a monthly plan. DataSeal works similarly to the other data removal companies on this list, but it stands out for its stellar customer service.</p>



<p>With DataSeal, you can sign up for breach alerts and agency protection in addition to the standard data removal. Unlike other data removal services that you only hear from when there’s a problem, DataSeal sends you weekly privacy and safety reports.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>24/7 monitoring</li>



<li>Weekly reports</li>



<li>Coverage for unlimited addresses, phones, and emails</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>No free trial</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Price</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>$12.99 per month for the individual plan</li>



<li>$10.99 per month for the family plan</li>



<li>$8.99 per month for the business plan</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-privacybee">PrivacyBee</h3>



<p>One of the standout features of <a href="https://privacybee.com/">PrivacyBee</a> is the free risk assessment. You can do a scan using their service to see how much of your personal info is available, and decide whether you want to take action. You can also get breach monitoring with a free account.</p>



<p>If you want proactive data removal (i.e. they contact brokers and people search sites on your behalf), you’ll have to upgrade to a paid account. While PrivacyBee’s search and features are comprehensive, it only lets you enter one name, one email address, one phone number, etc. If you want it to scan for and remove multiple email addresses, for example, you’ll have to get a second account.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Free risk assessment</li>



<li>Helps you opt out of junk mail by industry</li>



<li>Browser extension to limit tracking</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>One of the most expensive data removal services on the market</li>



<li>Plans don’t include coverage for multiple phones, emails, and addresses</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Price</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>$197 per year</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kanary">Kanary</h3>



<p>Like PrivacyBee, <a href="https://www.kanary.com/">Kanary</a> offers a free version of their product with limited features. You can track two names, two addresses, one username, one email account, and one phone number with Kanary’s free tier. You also get three automated removals without having to pay a dime (competitors will monitor for free but won’t over the removal unless you pay).</p>



<p>Kanary’s scan covers Google search results plus 327 sites — many more than some of its competitors. The automated opt-out process only works for about 260 of those sites, however. You have to pay for the highest tier to get all those opt-out options as well.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Full transparency on how it handles each broker site</li>



<li>Data removal automation</li>



<li>Multi-factor authentication</li>



<li>Free trial</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Automated opt–out doesn’t apply to every site</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Price</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Free-forever plan with limited features</li>



<li>$12 per month for an individual</li>



<li>$20.75 per month for a family</li>
</ul>



<p></p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/106-1024x683.jpg" alt="What information can data brokers acquire?" class="wp-image-6205" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/106-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/106-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/106-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/106.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are data brokers and how do they get your info?</h2>



<p>Data brokers are websites that gather publicly available information about individuals to build a profile about them. They scrape public records, social media, online retailers, and web forums to find information. They also pay other data brokers.</p>



<p>Also known as people search sites or people lookup sites, data brokers may have any of the following information about you:</p>



<ul>
<li>Name</li>



<li>Date of birth</li>



<li>Address</li>



<li>Phone number</li>



<li>Email address</li>



<li>Place of work</li>



<li>Schools attended</li>
</ul>



<p>As you can imagine, having this type of personal information available online for anyone to see can be a security risk. Hackers and cybercriminals can use these people search sites to build a profile of you and make their attack more targeted. If your name and info appears on a data broker site, you should probably try to get rid of it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much does it cost to remove your personal information from the internet?</h2>



<p>The cost of removing your information from the web can range from $10 per month to a flat fee of $2,500. The services mentioned on our list all charge based on a subscription model. You sign up and pay a monthly fee, and they offer continued monitoring and data removal requests on your behalf.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Remove your info and protect your privacy</h2>



<p>Technically, you don’t need any of these services to help you remove your information from the internet. You can do it yourself. But that is time-consuming and inefficient. Your info could be present on multiple data broker and people search sites, and you would have to submit a takedown request to each site, one by one.</p>



<p>Tools like Incogni or DataSeal can take care of this for you. Not to mention they have better monitoring than you likely do — without an app or software to help you out, the info you can find is limited to whatever shows up on a Google search.</p>



<p>Take charge of your privacy and security online. For a small fee, you can have an expert service help clean up your data. You need not necessarily pay for one of these services indefinitely. Once you have your information removed once, you can secure your online accounts to prevent your info from falling into data brokers’ hands again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>AI and U.S. copyright law are like your Facebook relationship status from 2011 — it’s complicated. For now, works created with generative AI cannot be copyrighted. Things created <em>partially</em> by AI can have a copyright, but only for the part the AI didn’t create. But as humans and machines continue working together the lines will get blurrier, making copyright law even messier.</p>



<p>There are also concerns over copyrighted material being used to train AI. It’s allowed for now, but it could also become more complicated as our use of AI continues to evolve.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="685" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a57-1024x685.jpg" alt="Internet law concept" class="wp-image-6195" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a57-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a57-300x201.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a57-768x514.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a57.jpg 1196w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-generative-ai-works">How Generative AI Works</h2>



<p>Generative AI tools like Midjourney and <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/openai-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> create images or texts based on prompts you give them. For a text-to-image tool, the prompt could be something like, “computer hacker in pixar movie style.” AI will spit out images for you to choose from. </p>



<p>For a generative text tool, you could ask for “a short essay about why cyber security is important” and it would write the essay for you. AI is able to create these images and texts using machine learning. It looks at millions of other images and texts — that were created by humans, mostly — and uses them to produce “original” works.</p>



<p>If the results you get from a generative AI tool are just culminations of other people’s work, does that make them original?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is AI protected by copyright?</h2>



<p>In the U.S., works created with AI tools are not protected by copyright. The U.S. Copyright Office issued a decision in March, 2023 clarifying that works created using artificial intelligence are not eligible for copyright, even if they were created using prompts written by a human.</p>



<p>Does that mean that if you use AI <em>at all</em> in your creation that it can’t be copyrighted? Not exactly. You can still copyright your work, but only the portions of it that were created <em>without</em> AI.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Case of Zarya of the Dawn</h3>



<p>This stance from the U.S. Copyright Office came out of a <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/docs/zarya-of-the-dawn.pdf">case involving a comic book</a> that included illustrations created by generative AI tool Midjourney. The author of the graphic novel <em>Zarya of the Dawn, </em>Kristina Kashtanova, was originally granted a full copyright for the work in September 2022.</p>



<p>However, it was rescinded when the Copyright Office learned that Kashtanova used AI for the illustrations. She still has a copyright over the text in the novel, since she wrote that herself.</p>



<p>It boils down to this: if a human didn’t create something, it can’t be protected by copyright.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who owns the copyright for works created by artificial intelligence?</h2>



<p>Nobody owns the copyright for works created by AI. The U.S. Copyright Office has made it clear that works created by AI fail the human authorship requirement. The same idea applies to animals who have managed to take photographs in the past — those photos can’t be copyrighted either.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is it illegal to sell AI-generated art?</h3>



<p>You could reasonably say, therefore, that a work created with artificial intelligence is free to use as you wish. Does that mean you can sell images or texts made with AI? In most cases, yes. As long as the user agreement of the AI tool you’re using permits it, you can sell AI-generated art.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are AI-generated images copyright free?</h2>



<p>Images created with AI do not carry a copyright — which is good news and bad news. It’s good if you’re looking for a sort-of customized image for a blog post, email, social media post, or similar project. It’s not good if you’re a creator whose work is used to train the AI, and the AI becomes capable of producing work strikingly similar to yours.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a56-1024x683.jpg" alt="Magnifying glass focusing on the word copyright
" class="wp-image-6197" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a56-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a56-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a56-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/a56.jpg 1199w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can AI use copyrighted works?</h2>



<p>Generative AI tools are able to produce “original”&nbsp; works by training on works actually created by humans. The AI can produce an image in the style of Andy Warhol because it studied the actual works of Andy Warhol. AI is allowed to train on copyrighted material as well, due to certain fair use laws.</p>



<p>If AI is using copyrighted material to create images, texts, or other works that very closely resemble the human-made original, is that stealing?</p>



<p>Legally, no. However, some artists and creators are arguing that it is. A <a href="https://newsroom.gettyimages.com/en/getty-images/getty-images-statement">lawsuit by Getty Images</a> against Stability AI states that their generative AI tool Stable Diffusion copied and processed millions of copyright-protected images from Getty — without getting permission or offering compensation.</p>



<p>Another class action lawsuit from three artists claims copyright infringement by Stability AI and Midjourney. The <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/ai-art-generators-lawsuit-stable-diffusion-midjourney">artists claim</a> their work was unlawfully used to train the AI, and the AI can now create works that compete with their own.</p>



<p>For now, AI tools can still train on copyrighted materials. But that may change in the near future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deciding Who Has Rights in the Future of AI</h2>



<p>It didn’t take long for conversations about copyright and ownership to pop up after the explosion of generative AI tools. Whether or not you agree with the stance the U.S. Copyright Office has taken on the matter, you should know how ownership of creative works if you’re planning to use AI for your own creations.</p>



<p>If you are a creator, you should also keep a close eye on this space and watch how it develops. As the way we use AI continues to evolve, so will our rules and laws about copyright.</p>

<p>Whether you’re talking to a friend, interviewing a potential employee, making a sale, or recruiting a spy, human psychology doesn’t change. The foundations of an honest conversation are the same. We can use communication techniques to inspire trust and get the information we need. Master manipulators may know how to sound good without answering your questions, but they can’t outsmart your gut. Knowing what builds trust in a conversation can also help you spot when someone is untrustworthy.</p>



<script async="" data-type="track" data-hash="32XDRaOgO0" data-track="180" src="https://app.fusebox.fm/embed/player.js"></script><br>



<p><em>See </em><a href="https://www.easyprey.com/behavioral-analysis-from-an-fbi-expert-with-robin-dreeke/"><em>Behavioral Analysis from an FBI Expert with Robin Dreeke</em></a><em> for a complete transcript of the Easy Prey podcast episode.</em></p>



<p>Robin Dreeke is a former US Marine Corps officer and a retired FBI special agent. During his time at the FBI, he recruited spies, worked as a counterintelligence agent, and served as Chief of the Counterintelligence Behavioral Analysis Program. He strategized human interactions, recruited spies, and did double agent operations – exactly what you think of when you think of “spy stuff.” He also spent years as an instructor at the Counterintelligence Training Center. In addition, he is a keynote speaker and podcaster and has written three books about <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-read-body-language">behavior analysis</a> and communication techniques.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-scam-attempt-that-caught-robin">The Scam Attempt that Caught Robin</h2>



<p>Robin has been a victim of a lot of attempts at scams and fraud. But most of them didn’t go too far. Only one has made it far enough for him to react. It was around 2010. He was still with the FBI, at the time an instructor at a training center in Quantico, but also was becoming a public figure with a social media presence.</p>



<p>While driving one day, he got a message on <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/how-to-get-banned-from-facebook">Facebook</a> Messenger from his daughter, a teenager at the time. It said, “Dad, this strange picture of you popped up on Facebook, you might want to take a look.” Being a public persona and an FBI agent, Robin was understandably concerned. He immediately pulled over and clicked on the link. Typical Facebook pages can’t be seen if you’re not logged in, so Robin entered his login information on the screen.</p>



<p>Only once he was “logged in” did his logical thinking kick in. He realized he had most likely just given his Facebook username and password to a <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/fake-websites-imitating-real-websites">fake website</a> sending the information to scammers. Robin stayed pulled over on the side of the road while he changed every single password he had. In the end, nothing every came of it – likely because he realized his mistake and reacted so fast.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why This Scam Worked</h3>



<p>This was an example of falling prey to your own confirmation biases. If you’re looking at things too emotionally or expect to see certain things, you won’t be able to see what’s really happening. You’ll only be able to see what you expect to see. When something or someone deviates from the normal pattern of behavior, you should <em>not</em> act. Look more closely at the situation before you react.</p>



<p>What Robin should have recognized in the message from his “daughter” was a deviation from his daughter’s behavior. She had never messaged him on Messenger before. That deviation should have made him stop and think. Instead, his curiosity and his concern that people would put compromising information about him online overrode his logical thinking. If he had stopped for a few moments to think, he would have realized the message was unusual for his daughter and become suspicious.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If we can let go of our agenda … and we see what is rather than what we’re trying to see with our own confirmation biases, we take in a lot more data. </p>
<cite>Robin Dreeke</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Identifying Behavioral Patterns</h2>



<p>Every day, with everyone around us, we are establishing normal patterns of behavior. We are also establishing tempo, or the speed and rhythm that people tend to use. Robin’s neighbors raise honey bees, and one day Robin and his wife found a swarm in their bush. His wife was freaking out, but Robin wasn’t. It was because he was observing the tempo. The bees’ tempo was slower, not agitated, and the tempo didn’t change as Robin walked around. There was no danger. Obviously, he didn’t want to go up and slap them. Changing his tempo would impact their tempo. The same is true for humans – we can be influenced by the environment around us. But by knowing what the normal tempo is, we can spot when something is off.</p>



<p>The point is that you’re not <em>trying</em> to see anything. You can’t look for anything specific, or your confirmation bias will ensure you see it. Just watch what is there, and observe if something is out of tempo or out of place. You’ve probably heard the phrase, “If you see something, say something.” What that’s really saying is to look for deviations. If you spot a tempo, an object, or a behavior that seems out of place, that’s something that needs to be investigated.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1207340251-1024x683.jpg" alt="These conversation techniques can help you have more open conversations." class="wp-image-6174" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1207340251-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1207340251-300x200.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1207340251-768x512.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1207340251-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1207340251-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p>The same thing is true when we have a feeling that a friend is upset or something is off. We’re picking up on an incongruence between their words and their behavior. The things they’re saying might sound right, but it doesn’t match the emotions they’re expressing nonverbally. For many of us, this is a gut feeling. We pick up on it but aren’t sure why. But learning to consciously spot behavior and tempo changes is a great communication technique. It can lead to better, more open conversations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Demonstrating the Core Behaviors for Trust</h3>



<p>There are three core behaviors for trust: Openness, transparency, and vulnerability. If someone is not demonstrating these behaviors, you’re going to pick up on that. The trap many people fall into when we bring these communication techniques into conscious awareness is trying to label it. We identify an incongruence between words and behavior, or we sense that the person we’re talking to isn’t being fully open, transparent, or vulnerable with us.</p>



<p>Our instinct is to label it: The person is obviously lying or trying to deceive or manipulate us. But when we start placing those emotional labels on people, their defenses come up. You’re going to get into a conflict. It’s possible that their intention is self-centered and they are trying to take advantage of us or hide something. But it’s also possible the reason you feel something is off has nothing to do with you or any attempt to manipulate you.</p>



<p>When you start to notice changes in the normal pattern or feel like someone isn’t being fully open, transparent, or vulnerable with you, it’s time to engage another essential communication technique: Curiosity. Note that something is different and unusual, and start to wonder why. Then ask questions. If you’re talking to a friend, it could be as simple as saying, “Something seems a little off with you today. Is everything okay?” Or you could say something like, “I don’t fully understand, can you please explain more thoroughly?” If it’s a healthy relationship or conversation, the person should be able to give you an explanation. But if they start to “double-talk” – using a lot of words that sound good but don’t actually explain anything – that’s a sign that something unhealthy is happening.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“Indicators” and Communication Techniques for Trust</h2>



<p>Another trap that many people fall into is looking for “indicators.” Indicators are specific words or phrases that people think point to something deeper or the “real truth” behind what someone is saying. But watching for indicators isn’t a communication technique. There are no magic words or key phrases that will secretly reveal what someone really thinks. And if you’re spending the entire conversation listening for key words or specific phrases, you’re going to miss what’s actually being said and the pattern changes that really tell you something is going on. Don’t listen for indicators, listen to understand.</p>



<p>If you don’t understand what someone’s saying, be curious. If you’re trying to create trust and determine if someone is trustworthy, curiosity is a fantastic communication technique. Focus on the other person and ask questions. “Why” questions are great because they force people to be very specific. If someone wants you to do something now and you ask why, they’ll give you reasons. These reasons may be why it’s beneficial to you. Or they could be a more simple answer – “I’m on a deadline and if I don’t meet my quota I won’t get my bonus this month,” for example. That’s openness and transparency there. They’re willing to tell you what’s going on behind the scenes. That’s an indicator that you can trust them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Questions: An Essential Communication Technique</h3>



<p>If you’re still not sure about their trustworthiness, stay curious and ask more questions. Questions are going to be the biggest communication technique in your arsenal to determine if someone is trustworthy. Ask them about the company and its quota system, what kind of bonuses they’ll lose out on, how long they’ve been with the company, and if they like it there. When asking these “discovery questions,” watch the tempo and consistency of the responses. If they continue with a nice, even tempo, that’s another verification of trust. But if you detect they’re not telling you something, slow it down even further and ask more questions.</p>



<p>There’s an expression in aviation: “No emergency takeoffs.” Don’t be in a rush to get in the air – it will cause an emergency landing, or worse. Take your time and do your due diligence. The same is true when determining if you can trust someone. Ask questions and pay attention to their answers. “Why” questions are especially powerful as a communication technique. They require people to have a big-picture overview and explain the reasoning behind decisions.</p>



<p>Artful <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/negotiation-techniques">negotiators</a>, communicators, and manipulators are great at using words that make you feel like a million bucks. But they’re also great at doing that without really telling you anything. If you use “why” questions, it forces them to give you more information – or makes it much more obvious that they’re not telling you anything at all.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Real Vulnerability vs. Contrived Vulnerability</h2>



<p>Vulnerability is a key part of building trust. But manipulators can contrive vulnerability to trick you into trusting them. But you can use communication techniques to identify real vulnerability. To start, you have to know what vulnerability is. It’s the willingness to show your shame. Shame is a powerful emotion, and it dictates a lot of things in life.</p>



<p>One of the most common job interview questions asks about your weaknesses. When Robin interviewed people for the behavioral team, he always asked what they were working on in life. The goal is for the interviewee to be open and honest about what they’re not good at. If they were answering honestly, with congruent nonverbal communication and a consistent tempo, and willing to say what they weren’t good at, they were someone to trust.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If you’re willing to be vulnerable and transparent on the things you’re deficient at, then I can most likely trust you. </p>
<cite>Robin Dreeke</cite></blockquote>



<p>Again, questions are going to be the communication technique you use here. If you are skeptical if someone is truly being vulnerable, ask more questions. Ask them about a time they fell short or failed, or about challenges in their career. And when they respond, look for congruence between their words and their behavior. The tempo of their responses should be consistent.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Establishing a Baseline</h3>



<p>What makes these questions useful as a communication technique to establish trust is knowing a person’s baseline. It’s hard to spot inconsistencies in behavior patterns and tempo if you don’t know what the normal pattern is for that person. And every person is unique. It’s important to start a conversation with a low-stakes topic – idle talk about the weather, where they’re from, or something similar. Pay attention to their behavior and tempo about these topics. Then you have something to compare to determine if they’re being genuinely vulnerable.</p>



<p>When establishing the baseline of that tempo, more data is better. The longer you’ve talked to someone and observed their behavior patterns and tempo, the better you will be at identifying changes and adapting to them. There’s no set amount of time you need to gather this baseline data. Everyone’s tempo and patterns are different. It depends on the individual.</p>



<p>If you are good at interacting and both of you are being open, transparent, and vulnerable, eventually your tempo will come into sync. Don’t force it – when it happens naturally, it feels great, but when it’s forced, the other person feels that something is wrong. The more you create trust, try to understand the other person, and stay in the present moment with them without trying to manipulate or extract information, your tempos will converge. That’s a great point where fantastic relationships can be built.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using Communication Techniques to Identify an Unhealthy Conversation</h2>



<p>When we know what a good conversation looks like, we can reverse it. The reverse is what an unhealthy conversation looks like. Unhealthy conversations use communication techniques against us to try to force decisions or trick us into trust.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="696" src="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-1024x696.jpg" alt="Understanding communication techniques can help you spot an unhealthy conversation." class="wp-image-6175" srcset="https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-1024x696.jpg 1024w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-300x204.jpg 300w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-768x522.jpg 768w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-1536x1044.jpg 1536w, https://whatismyipaddress.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock-1434334248-2048x1392.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>An unhealthy conversation will not be open or accommodating. Most people trying to manipulate you have an agenda and are on a timeline. They will try to push the tempo out of your comfort zone. If you are using good communication techniques, asking curious questions and trying to slow the tempo down, and they are not accommodating that change and trying to push it, that’s when it’s time to be done.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>That’s what you always want to watch. Watch for someone trying to push that tempo. </p>
<cite>Robin Dreeke</cite></blockquote>



<p>Someone who’s pushing the tempo has an agenda they’re not telling you. At best, that’s unhealthy. At worst, they’re trying to manipulate you. Rushing that tempo keeps you off-kilter. They also use it to get verbal commitments really quickly. Once we verbally commit to something, it’s hard to backtrack. We want to validate our own thoughts and opinions and don’t want information that contradicts what we’ve already obligated ourselves to. It’s emotionally difficult to back out of a commitment, so manipulators try to get a commitment from you as fast as possible.</p>



<p>Bad salespeople do this too. They often end up closing the sale, but they’ve ruined any chance of referral and left the buyer with buyer’s remorse. Even if the person pushing the tempo isn’t trying to defraud you, it’s a bad sign. Use good communication techniques and try to slow it down. If they keep trying to force your tempo, it’s time to leave the situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Use Communication Techniques to Have Great Conversations</h2>



<p>These communication techniques are not tools to call out liars or accuse people of manipulation. Rather, they’re ways to facilitate good, open, transparent conversations. Focus on having great conversations with people. Observe changes in behavior and tempo, and don’t assign meaning to them – get curious and ask questions.</p>



<p>A great way to inspire people to not want to take advantage of you is to make it about them. When you make the conversation about them and listen to understand their thoughts and feelings, you become a real person to someone. If they can objectify you, it’s easy to take advantage. But if you become a real person to them, it’s much harder.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The easiest way to not be a victim is to inspire people to not want to victimize you. </p>
<cite>Robin Dreeke</cite></blockquote>



<p>Make it personal, and go down a road where it’s all about them. Seek their thoughts and opinions instead of sharing yours. Talk in terms of their priorities, challenges, and pain points. Validate them with non-judgmental curiosity about who they are. Empower them with choices. When you do these things, it becomes about them. Their brains reward them with serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin. When someone’s oxytocin is flowing with you, the likelihood that they want to take advantage of you diminishes greatly. Robin isn’t saying it won’t happen – but it’s much less likely.</p>
