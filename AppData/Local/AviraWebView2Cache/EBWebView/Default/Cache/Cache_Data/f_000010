It is secured by cryptographic protocols that make it almost impossible to counterfeit. Cryptocurrencies can be used just like regular money to purchase goods or services either directly or by exchanging them with fiat currency according to their current value. They exist in the form of digital tokens that are based on a technology called a blockchain.","a_2_title":"Ethereum","a_2_desc":"Ethereum is the second biggest cryptocurrency globally after Bitcoin, but has various advantages over it. Among them, Ethereum is open-source and can also be used to create self-executing contracts and run decentralized applications.","a_3_title":"Blockchain","a_3_desc":"A blockchain is a decentralized technology that acts like a distributed ledger to store and manage transactions made in cryptocurrencies over a network. A blockchain functions independently of central authorities like banks and governments, removing outside interference from financial transactions between users. Anything stored on the blockchain is immutable and secure, thereby safeguarding financial data and assets.","a_4_desc_1":"Cryptomining involves entities called miners using their computing power to compete to solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions on the blockchain and add blocks to it. The process requires enormous computational power. Among the many miners who compete to solve problems and add blocks, the miner that can do it most accurately is rewarded with a digital token.","a_4_desc_2":"One way in which mining can be profitable is through mining pools. These enable miners to pool their resources — improving their chance of mining cryptocurrency — and share the rewards.

Transaction fees fluctuate due to cryptocurrency market conditions and other factors. These fees are not set or collected by Avira.","a_10_desc_2":"Please note that Avira makes no statements or guarantees on the financial benefits that you can derive from using the product given the many variables involved including factors like the volatility in value of the currency, the time and effort required to mine a particular block, the equipment utilized and its cost, the amount and cost of additional energy consumption, and associated fees, among others."},"coinbase":{"link_account":"Link your Coinbase account","create_account":"Create a Coinbase account","withdraw_to_coinbase":"Withdraw to Coinbase","available_balance":"Current balance","withdraw_from":"Withdraw from","select_account":"Select account","select_account_error":"Please select a wallet","withdraw_to":"Withdraw to","max":"All funds","amount_error_1":"Please enter an amount","amount_error_2":"Enter an amount higher than the network fee","amount_error_3":"Enter an amount equal to or lower than your balance","processing_time":"Processing time","processing_time_desc":"This is the time it takes for your transaction to be confirmed.
