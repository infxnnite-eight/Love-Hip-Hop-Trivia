chatgpt answering === operator meaning 


					In JavaScript, the === operator is known as the 
					"strict equality" operator. 
					It's used to compare two values for equality while taking both their values and data types into account. 
					In other words, it checks whether two values are exactly the same in terms of both value and type.

When you use the === operator to compare two values, the following rules apply:

If the values have different data types, they are considered not strictly equal.
If the values have the same data type but different values, they are considered not strictly equal.
If the values have the same data type and the same value, they are considered strictly equal.
Here are some examples to illustrate the concept:


					Truthy Values:

All non-empty strings
All numbers except 0 and NaN
Objects (including arrays and functions)
The special value Infinity
The special value -Infinity
Falsy Values:

An empty string ("")
The number 0
NaN (Not-a-Number)
null
undefined
