in computer seince data is anything that is meaningful to the computer 
javascript provides 7 different types of data...


1. undefined: is something that hasn't been defined " you m 
2. null: null mean nothing, " you set it to be something but it means nothing" 
3. boolean: true or false
4. string: is a any sort of text 
5. symbol: is a primative value that is unique
6. number: is a number
7. object: can store alot of key value pair

you often are gonna set data into a VAR - 
a variable is like a box - 


var myName = "Beau"

myName = 8

in the variable you set data type like the e.g above & 
right here > let goodMorning = 3 am
// this means it's the the morning time and it's 3 am!

let thereBePeace = "LoveEveryday"

// there will be peace everyday!

const pi = 3.14

the first variable "let" , "var" , & "if" are way to describe
and declare the variable

- Storing Values with assignment operator

there is a different with declaring variables and assigning variables
 
1: var a; - declaring a variable
2: var b = 2; - declaring (var b) and assigning (=2;)

assigning a variable & closing script
 
var a;

declaring a variable, assigning a variable, and closing script

var b = 2;

(declaring variable) var b (declaring variable) (assigning to variable) = 2; (assigning to variable); (end of the line)

a = 7;

assigning variable with a closing tag. 

var b = 7; 

declare, assign variables, with a closing line.

b = a;
assign a to b,with a closing line.

console.log allows you to see things in the console

e.g. 
asign a to 7 with a closing line.


a = 7;

- what ever you put in the () you can see in it in the console.

console.log (a)
 7


- Initializing Variables w/ Assignment Operator
e.g.
								 
(declaring) var a (declaring) (Initializing) = 9; (Initializing)
								Initializing operator is "="
	declaring variable is "a"
	 to
	- Initializing Variables w/ Assignment Operator
	
	uninitialize these three variables
	
	undefined variables
	e.g.
	var 5; 
	let 6;
	const 5;
				//there undefined variables in javascript because they have not yet been assign to anything.
				they have only been declared.
				
	e.g.
	
	(undefined) var	5; (undefined)
	e.g.
	
					var 5 > 2;
					
			declaring variable: var 5
						 Initializing operator: > 2;
												the operator it the less the 2.

- Checkout Function
	- add items 
	- totalcost
	
	e.g function additem (name, price) [
	
	let items = []
	let item = { name: name, price: price}
	items.push (item)
	}
	
	they property value pairs (like css)
	but unlike css they do not have a a defined or a named property name.
	e.g css
	const cant be change
	
	
	function dante(smartguy) = 100 {
	console.log "Hello, " + name + "!");
	}
	
	function dorian(smartestguy = 100) {
	console.log ("Hello, " + smartestguy + "!");
	}
	
	dorian("CodeNameNeoFromTheMatrix"); // Say: "Hello, Dorian!"
	
	
	
	let a = 
	
	let numberArray
	
	function sum (numbers)
	let result = 0
	for 
	
	result 
	
	console.log
	return result

				- javascript 
					1. Set The Variable
				
				1v5. Define Variables 
					2. Use Operators
					3. Execute Code
			
	1.1 - Let, Const, Var
	1.2 - Define the Variable theComputer
